/** @brief Number Of Completed Packets.
 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v6.0,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.7.19
 *
 * The HCI_Number_Of_Completed_Packets event is used by the Controller to indicate to
 * the Host how many HCI Data packets or HCI ISO Data packets have been completed
 * for each Handle since the previous HCI_Number_Of_Completed_Packets event was
 * sent to the Host. This means that the corresponding buffer space has been freed in the
 * Controller and is available for new packets to be sent. Based on this information and
 * the return parameters of the HCI_Read_Buffer_Size and HCI_LE_Read_Buffer_Size
 * commands, the Host can determine for which Handles the following HCI packets should
 * be sent to the Controller. The HCI_Number_Of_Completed_Packets event shall not
 * specify a given Handle before the Controller has sent the event indicating that the
 * corresponding connection or BIG has been created or after it has sent the event
 * indicating disconnection of the corresponding connection or indicating that the BIG has
 * been terminated. While the Controller has HCI Data packets or HCI ISO Data packets
 * in its buffer, it shall keep sending the HCI_Number_Of_Completed_Packets event to the
 * Host at least periodically, until it finally reports that all the pending packets have been
 * completed. The rate with which this event is sent is manufacturer specific.
 *
 * Note: HCI_Number_Of_Completed_Packets events will not report on synchronous
 * Connection_Handles if synchronous Flow Control is disabled. (See Section 7.3.36 and
 * Section 7.3.37.)

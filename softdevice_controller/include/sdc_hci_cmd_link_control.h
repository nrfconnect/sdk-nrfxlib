/** @brief Disconnect.
 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v6.0,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.1.6
 *
 * The HCI_Disconnect command is used to terminate an existing connection. The
 * Connection_Handle parameter indicates which connection is to be disconnected. The
 * Reason parameter indicates the reason for ending the connection and is copied into
 * the error code field of the LMP_DETACH PDU on a BR/EDR connection or the
 * error code field of the LL_TERMINATE_IND or LL_CIS_TERMINATE_IND PDU on
 * an LE connection. All SCO, eSCO, and CIS connections on a physical link should
 * be disconnected before the ACL connection on the same physical connection is
 * disconnected. If it does not, they will be implicitly disconnected as part of the ACL
 * disconnection.
 *
 * If, on the Central, the Host issues this command before issuing the
 * HCI_LE_Create_CIS command for the same CIS (including if a previous CIS with the
 * same CIS_ID in the same CIG has been terminated or considered lost), then the
 * Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C). If the Host issues
 * this command when there is a pending HCI_LE_Create_CIS command for the same
 * CIS but before the CIS is created, then this command shall be successful and the CIS
 * shall not be created.
 *
 * Note: The CIS is created when the Central sends an LL_CIS_IND PDU to the
 * Peripheral for that CIS (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section 5.1.15).
 *
 * Note: If the Controller follows the requirements of version v5.4 of this specification or
 * lower, it may return an error if this command is issued before the CIS is created.
 *
 * If, on the Peripheral, the Host issues this command before the Controller has generated
 * the HCI_LE_CIS_Established event for that CIS, then the Controller shall return the
 * error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * Note: As specified in Section 7.7.5, on the Central, the handle for a CIS remains valid
 * even after disconnection and, therefore, the Host can recreate a disconnected CIS at a
 * later point in time using the same connection handle.
 *
 * Event(s) generated (unless masked away):
 * When the Controller receives the HCI_Disconnect command, it shall send the
 * HCI_Command_Status event to the Host. The HCI_Disconnection_Complete event will
 * occur at each Host when the termination of the connection has completed, and on
 * the local Host also indicates that this command has been completed. The Reason
 * parameter in the event on the local Host shall be set to the value Connection
 * Terminated by Local Host (0x16), while that on the remote Host shall be set to the
 * value of Reason. However, if the termination procedure completes because a timer
 * expires and, therefore, the local Controller cannot determine whether or not Reason
 * was received by the remote Controller, the Reason parameter on the local Host should
 * instead be set to the value LMP Response Timeout / LL Response Timeout (0x22).
 *
 * If this command is issued for a CIS on the Central and the CIS is successfully
 * terminated before being created, or after being created but before being established,
 * then an HCI_LE_CIS_Established event shall also be sent for this CIS with the Status
 * Operation Cancelled by Host (0x44).
 *
 * @param[in]  p_params Input parameters.
 *
 * @retval 0 if success.
 * @return Returns value between 0x01-0xFF in case of error.
 *         See Vol 2, Part D, Error for a list of error codes and descriptions.

/** @brief Read Remote Version Information.
 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v6.0,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.1.23
 *
 * This command will obtain the values for the version information for the remote device
 * identified by the Connection_Handle parameter. The Connection_Handle shall be a
 * Connection_Handle for an ACL-U or LE-U logical link.
 *
 * Event(s) generated (unless masked away):
 * When the Controller receives the HCI_Read_Remote_Version_Information command,
 * the Controller shall send the HCI_Command_Status event to the Host.
 * When the Link Manager or Link Layer has completed the sequence to
 * determine the remote version information, the local Controller shall send
 * an HCI_Read_Remote_Version_Information_Complete event to the Host. The
 * HCI_Read_Remote_Version_Information_Complete event contains the status of this
 * command, and parameters describing the version and subversion of the LMP or Link
 * Layer used by the remote device.

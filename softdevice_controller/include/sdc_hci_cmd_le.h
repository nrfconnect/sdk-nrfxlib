/** @brief LE Set Event Mask.
 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v5.3,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.8.1
 *
 * The HCI_LE_Set_Event_Mask command is used to control which LE events
 * are generated by the HCI for the Host. If the bit in the LE_Event_Mask is set to
 * a one, then the event associated with that bit will be enabled. The event mask
 * allows the Host to control which events will interrupt it.
 *
 * The Controller shall ignore those bits which are reserved for future use or
 * represent events which it does not support. If the Host sets any of these bits to
 * 1, the Controller shall act as if they were set to 0.
 *
 * For LE events to be generated, the LE Meta event bit in the Event_Mask shall
 * also be set. If that bit is not set, then LE events shall not be generated,
 * regardless of how the LE_Event_Mask is set.
 *
 * Event(s) generated (unless masked away):
 * When the HCI_LE_Set_Event_Mask command has completed, an
 * HCI_Command_Complete event shall be generated.
 *
 * @param[in]  p_params Input parameters.
 *

/** @brief LE Read Buffer Size [v1].
 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v5.3,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.8.2
 *
 * This command is used to read the maximum size of the data portion of ACL
 * data packets and isochronous data packets sent from the Host to the Control-
 * ler. The Host shall segment the data transmitted to the Controller according to
 * these values so that the HCI ACL Data packets and HCI ISO Data packets will
 * contain data up to this size. The HCI_LE_Read_Buffer_Size command also
 * returns the total number of HCI LE ACL Data packets and isochronous data
 * packets that can be stored in the data buffers of the Controller. The HCI_LE_-
 * Read_Buffer_Size command shall be issued by the Host before it sends any
 * data to an LE Controller (see Section 4.1.1). If the Controller supports HCI ISO
 * Data packets, it shall return non-zero values for the ISO_Data_Packet_Length
 * and Total_Num_ISO_Data_Packets parameters.
 *
 * If the Controller returns a length value of zero for ACL data packets, the Host
 * shall use the HCI_Read_Buffer_Size command to determine the size of the
 * data buffers (shared between BR/EDR and LE transports).
 *
 * Note: Both the HCI_Read_Buffer_Size command and the HCI_LE_Read_-
 * Buffer_Size command may return buffer length and number of packets param-
 * eter values that are nonzero. This allows a Controller to offer different buffers
 * and number of buffers for BR/EDR data packets and LE data packets.
 *
 * The LE_ACL_Data_Packet_Length return parameter shall be used to deter-
 * mine the maximum size of the L2CAP PDU segments that are contained in
 * ACL data packets, and which are transferred from the Host to the Controller to
 * be broken up into packets by the Link Layer. The Total_Num_LE_ACL_Data_-
 * Packets return parameter contains the total number of HCI ACL Data packets
 * that can be stored in the data buffers of the Controller. The Host determines
 * how to divide the buffers between different connection handles.
 *
 * The ISO_Data_Packet_Length return parameter shall be used to determine the
 * maximum size of the SDU segments that are contained in isochronous data
 * packets, and which are transferred from the Host to the Controller. The
 * Total_Num_ISO_Data_Packets return parameter contains the total number of
 * isochronous data packets that can be stored in the data buffers of the
 * Controller. The Host determines how to divide the buffers between different
 * connection handle(s).

 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v5.3,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.8.56
 *
 * The HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Advertising_Enable command is used to request
 * the Controller to enable or disable one or more advertising sets using the
 * advertising sets identified by the Advertising_Handle[i] parameter. The Control-
 * ler manages the timing of advertisements in accordance with the advertising
 * parameters given in the HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Advertising_Parameters
 * command. The Num_Sets parameter is the number of advertising sets
 * contained in the parameter arrays. If Enable and Num_Sets are both set to
 * 0x00, then all advertising sets are disabled.
 *
 * The Controller shall only start an advertising event when the corresponding
 * advertising set is enabled. The Controller shall continue advertising until all
 * advertising sets have been disabled. An advertising set shall be disabled when
 * the Host issues an HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Advertising_Enable command with
 * the Enable parameter set to 0x00 (Advertising is disabled), a connection is cre-
 * ated using that advertising set, the duration specified in the Duration[i] parame-
 * ter expires, or the number of extended advertising events transmitted for the
 * set exceeds the Max_Extended_Advertising_Events[i] parameter.
 *
 * The Duration[i] parameter indicates the duration for which that advertising set
 * is enabled. The duration begins at the start of the first advertising event of this
 * advertising set. The Controller should not start an extended advertising event
 * that it cannot complete within the duration.
 *
 * If the advertising is high duty cycle connectable directed advertising, then
 * Duration[i] shall be less than or equal to 1.28 seconds and shall not be equal to 0.
 *
 * The Max_Extended_Advertising_Events[i] parameter, if non-zero, indicates the
 * maximum number of extended advertising events that shall be sent prior to
 * disabling the extended advertising set even if the Duration[i] parameter has not
 * expired.
 *
 * Duration[i] and Max_Extended_Advertising_Events[i] shall be ignored when
 * Enable is set to 0x00.
 *
 * If the HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Advertising_Enable command is sent again for
 * an advertising set while that set is enabled, the timer used for the duration and
 * the number of events counter are reset and any change to the random address
 * shall take effect.
 *
 * Disabling the advertising set identified by the Advertising_Handle[i] parameter
 * does not disable any periodic advertising associated with that set.
 *
 * Disabling an advertising set that is already disabled has no effect.
 *
 * If the same advertising set is identified by more than one entry in the
 * Advertising_Handle[i] arrayed parameter, then the Controller shall return the
 * error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the advertising set corresponding to the Advertising_Handle[i] parameter
 * does not exist, then the Controller shall return the error code Unknown
 * Advertising Identifier (0x42).
 *
 * The remainder of this section only applies if Enable is set to 0x01.
 *
 * If Num_Sets is set to 0x00, the Controller shall return the error code Invalid HCI
 * Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the advertising set contains partial advertising data or partial scan response
 * data, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the advertising set uses scannable extended advertising PDUs and no scan
 * response data is currently provided, the Controller shall return the error code
 * Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the advertising set uses connectable extended advertising PDUs and the
 * advertising data in the advertising set will not fit in the AUX_ADV_IND PDU,
 * the Controller shall return the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters
 * (0x12).
 *
 * Note: The maximum amount of data that will fit in the PDU depends on which
 * options are selected and on the maximum length of PDU that the Controller is
 * able to transmit.
 *
 * If extended advertising is being used and the length of any advertising data or
 * of any scan response data is greater than the maximum that the Controller can
 * transmit within the longest possible auxiliary advertising segment consistent
 * with the chosen advertising interval, the Controller shall return the error code
 * Packet Too Long (0x45). If advertising on the LE Coded PHY, the S=8 coding
 * shall be assumed.
 *
 * If the advertising set's Own_Address_Type parameter is set to 0x00 and the
 * device does not have a public address, the Controller should return an error
 * code which should be Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the advertising set's Own_Address_Type parameter is set to 0x01 and the
 * random address for the advertising set has not been initialized using the
 * HCI_LE_Set_Advertising_Set_Random_Address command, the Controller
 * shall return the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the advertising set's Own_Address_Type parameter is set to 0x02, the
 * Controller's resolving list did not contain a matching entry, and the device does
 * not have a public address, the Controller should return an error code which
 * should be Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the advertising set's Own_Address_Type parameter is set to 0x03, the
 * controller's resolving list did not contain a matching entry, and the random
 * address for the advertising set has not been initialized using the

 * Enhanced_Connection_Complete event with the Status parameter set to the
 * error code Advertising Timeout (0x3C) may be generated instead of or in addi-
 * tion to the HCI_LE_Advertising_Set_Terminated event. If the Controller gener-

 *
 * The HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Scan_Enable command is used to enable or

 *
 * The Enable parameter determines whether scanning is enabled or disabled. If
 * it is set to 0x00, the remaining parameters shall be ignored.
 *
 * If Enable is set to 0x01 and the Host has not issued the HCI_LE_Set_-
 * Extended_Scan_Parameters command, the Controller shall either use vendor-
 * specified parameters or return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * The Filter_Duplicates parameter controls whether the Link Layer should filter
 * out duplicate advertising reports (filtering duplicates enabled) to the Host or if
 * the Link Layer should generate advertising reports for each packet received
 * (filtering duplicates disabled). See [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.4.3.5.
 *
 * If the Filter_Duplicates parameter is set to 0x00, all advertisements received
 * from advertisers shall be sent to the Host in advertising report events.
 *
 * If the Filter_Duplicates parameter is set to 0x01, duplicate advertisements
 * should not be sent to the Host in advertising report events until scanning is
 * disabled.
 *
 * If the Filter_Duplicates parameter is set to 0x02, duplicate advertisements in a
 * single scan period should not be sent to the Host in advertising report events;
 * this setting shall only be used if both Period and Duration are non-zero. If
 * Filter_Duplicates is set to 0x02 and either Period or Duration to zero, the
 * Controller shall return the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the Duration parameter is zero or both the Duration parameter and Period
 * parameter are non-zero, the Controller shall continue scanning until scanning
 * is disabled by the Host issuing an HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Scan_Enable
 * command with the Enable parameter set to 0x00 (Scanning is disabled). The
 * Period parameter shall be ignored when the Duration parameter is zero.
 *
 * If the Duration parameter is non-zero and the Period parameter is zero, the

 * parameter has expired.
 * If both the Duration and Period parameters are non-zero and the Duration is
 * greater than or equal to the Period, the Controller shall return the error code
 * Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * When the Duration and Period parameters are non-zero, the Controller shall
 * scan for the duration of the Duration parameter within a scan period specified
 * by the Period parameter. After the scan period has expired, a new scan period
 * shall begin and scanning shall begin again for the duration specified. The scan
 * periods continue until the Host disables scanning.
 *
 * If the HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Scan_Enable command with Enable set to 0x01
 * is sent while scanning is already enabled, the timers used for duration and
 * period are reset to the new parameter values and a new scan period is started.
 * Any change to the Filter_Duplicates setting or the random address shall take
 * effect.
 *
 * Disabling scanning when it is disabled has no effect.
 *
 * Note: The duration of a scan period refers to the time spent scanning on both
 * the primary and secondary advertising physical channels. However, expiry of
 * the duration does not prevent the Link Layer from scanning for and receiving
 * auxiliary packets of received advertisements.
 *
 * If Enable is set to 0x01, the scanning parameters' Own_Address_Type

 * type and address of the advertising device to connect to.
 *
 * The Own_Address_Type parameter indicates the type of address being used

 *
 * The Peer_Address parameter indicates the Peer’s Public Device Address,
 * Random (static) Device Address, Non-Resolvable Private Address, or
 * Resolvable Private Address depending on the Peer_Address_Type parameter.
 *
 * The Initiating_PHYs parameter indicates the PHY(s) on which the advertising

 *
 * The HCI_LE_Periodic_Advertising_Create_Sync command is used to
 * synchronize with a periodic advertising train from an advertiser and begin
 * receiving periodic advertising packets.
 *
 * This command may be issued whether or not scanning is enabled and
 * scanning may be enabled and disabled (see the LE Set Extended Scan Enable
 * command) while this command is pending. However, synchronization can only
 * occur when scanning is enabled. While scanning is disabled, no attempt to
 * synchronize will take place.
 *
 * The Options parameter is used to determine whether the Periodic Advertiser
 * List is used, whether HCI_LE_Periodic_Advertising_Report events for this
 * periodic advertising train are initially enabled or disabled, and whether
 * duplicate reports are filtered or not. If the Periodic Advertiser List is not used,
 * the Advertising_SID, Advertiser Address_Type, and Advertiser Address
 * parameters specify the periodic advertising device to listen to; otherwise they
 * shall be ignored.
 *
 * The Advertising_SID parameter, if used, specifies the value that must match
 * the Advertising SID subfield in the ADI field of the received advertisement for it
 * to be used to synchronize.
 *
 * The Skip parameter specifies the maximum number of consecutive periodic
 * advertising events that the receiver may skip after successfully receiving a
 * periodic advertising packet.
 *
 * The Sync_Timeout parameter specifies the maximum permitted time between
 * successful receives. If this time is exceeded, synchronization is lost.
 *
 * The Sync_CTE_Type parameter specifies whether to only synchronize to
 * periodic advertising with certain types of Constant Tone Extension (a value of 0
 * indicates that the presence or absence of a Constant Tone Extension is
 * irrelevant). If the periodic advertising has the wrong type of Constant Tone
 * Extension then:
 * • If bit 0 of Options is set, the Controller shall ignore this address and SID and
 *   continue to search for other periodic advertisements.
 * • Otherwise, the Controller shall cancel the synchronization with the error
 *   code Unsupported Remote Feature (0x1A).
 *
 * If the periodic advertiser changes the type of Constant Tone Extension after the
 * scanner has synchronized with the periodic advertising, the scanner's Link
 * Layer shall remain synchronized.
 *
 * If the Host sets all the non-reserved bits of the Sync_CTE_Type parameter to
 * 1, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *

 * as those of a periodic advertising train that the Controller is already
 * synchronized to, the Controller shall return the error code Connection Already
 * Exists (0x0B).

 *
 * If bit 1 of the Options parameter is set to 1 and the Controller does not support

/** @brief LE Set Path Loss Reporting Parameters.
 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v5.3,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.8.119
 *
 * The HCI_LE_Set_Path_Loss_Reporting_Parameters command is used to set
 * the path loss threshold reporting parameters for the ACL connection identified
 * by the Connection_Handle parameter.
 *
 * The path loss threshold-based mechanism is described in [Vol 6] Part B,
 * Section 4.5.16. For each zone boundary, the upwards boundary shall equal the
 * threshold plus the hysteresis and the downwards boundary shall equal the
 * threshold minus the hysteresis.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command with High_Threshold+High_Hysteresis greater
 * than 0xFF or with Low_Threshold less than Low_Hysteresis, the Controller
 * shall return the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the Host issues this command with Low_Threshold greater than
 * High_Threshold or with Low_Threshold+Low_Hysteresis greater than
 * High_Threshold–High_Hysteresis, the Controller shall return the error code
 * Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * The Min_Time_Spent parameter indicates the minimum time that the Controller
 * shall observe the path loss has crossed the threshold before the Controller
 * generates an event for the threshold crossing. The Host should specify a
 * suitable value based on the connection interval, subrate factor, and Peripheral
 * latency.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command when path loss monitoring is enabled, the
 * Controller shall override the existing path loss threshold reporting parameters
 * with the parameters provided in this command.
 *
 * The High_Threshold and the Low_Threshold parameters are common to all
 * PHYs supported by the Controller. However, the Host can reissue this
 * command with suitable parameters whenever a PHY switch is detected.
 *
 * If the Connection_Handle parameter does not identify a current ACL
 * connection, the Controller shall return the error code Unknown Connection
 * Identifier (0x02).
 *
 * Event(s) generated (unless masked away):
 * When the HCI_LE_Set_Path_Loss_Reporting_Parameters command has
 * completed, an HCI_Command_Complete event shall be generated.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command when path loss monitoring is enabled, and if
 * the new parameters mean that the path loss is now in a different zone, an
 * HCI_LE_Path_Loss_Threshold event shall be generated as soon as possible
 * irrespective of the Min_Time_Spent parameter and the timer shall be reset.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command with High_Threshold parameter set to 0xFF,
 * then the Controller shall not generate an HCI_LE_Path_Loss_Threshold event
 * with Zone_Entered set to 0x02.
 *
 * @param[in]  p_params Input parameters.
 * @param[out] p_return Extra return parameters.
 *

/** @brief LE Set Path Loss Reporting Enable.
 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v5.3,

 *
 * The HCI_LE_Set_Path_Loss_Reporting_Enable command is used to enable

 * Connection_Handle parameter.
 *
 * If the Enable parameter is set to 0x01 and no prior LE Power Control Request
 * procedure has been initiated on the ACL connection, then the Controller may
 * need to initiate a new LE Power Control Request procedure on that ACL.
 *
 * Path loss reporting is disabled when the connection is first created.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command before it has issued the HCI_LE_Set_Path_-
 * Loss_Reporting_Parameters command on this connection, the Controller shall
 * return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the Connection_Handle parameter does not identify a current ACL
 * connection, the Controller shall return the error code Unknown Connection
 * Identifier (0x02).
 *
 * Enabling path loss monitoring when it is already enabled or disabling path loss
 * monitoring when it is already disabled has no effect.
 *
 * Event(s) generated (unless masked away):
 * When the HCI_LE_Set_Path_Loss_Reporting_Enable command has
 * completed, an HCI_Command_Complete event shall be generated.
 *
 * When reporting is enabled and was previously disabled, the Controller shall
 * generate an HCI_LE_Path_Loss_Threshold event as soon as it has a reliable
 * measurement of the path loss. If the Controller has to query the remote
 * Controller for its transmit power level, then it shall generate this event within
 * Tpath_loss_enable from the time it receives a response to its query. Otherwise, the
 * Controller shall generate this event within Tpath_loss_enable from the time the
 * command is issued. Tpath_loss_enable shall be Min_Time_Spent + 6 connection
 * events or, if longer, 2 connection events where the Controller actually receives
 * a packet from the peer, where Min_Time_Spent is specified by the
 * HCI_LE_Set_Path_Loss_Reporting_Parameters command.
 *
 * After the initial event on reporting being enabled, the Controller shall generate
 * this event each time it determines that the path loss has moved to a different
 * zone and stayed in that zone for Min_Time_Spent.As stated in [Vol 6] Part B,
 * Section 4.5.16, two consecutive events must not indicate the same zone.

 *
 * The HCI_LE_Extended_Advertising_Report event indicates that one or more Bluetooth
 * devices have responded to an active scan or have broadcast advertisements
 * that were received during a passive scan. The Controller may coalesce
 * multiple advertising reports from the same or different advertisers into a single
 * HCI_LE_Extended_Advertising_Report event, provided all the parameters from all the
 * advertising reports fit in a single HCI event.
 *
 * This event shall only be generated if scanning was enabled using the HCI_LE_Set_-
 * Extended_Scan_Enable command. It reports advertising events using either legacy or
 * extended advertising PDUs.
 *
 * The Controller may split the data from a single advertisement or scan response
 * (whether one PDU or several) into several reports. If so, each report except the
 * last shall have an Event_Type with a data status field of "incomplete, more data to
 * come", while the last shall have the value "complete"; the Address_Type, Address,
 * Advertising_SID, Primary_PHY, and Secondary_PHY fields shall be the same in all the
 * reports. No further reports shall be sent for a given advertisement or scan response
 * after one with a Data_Status other than "incomplete, more data to come".
 * When a scan response is received, bits 0 to 2 and 4 of the event type shall indicate the
 * properties of the original advertising event and the Advertising_SID field should be set
 * to the value in the original scannable advertisement.
 *
 * An Event_Type with a data status field of "incomplete, data truncated" shall indicate that
 * the Controller attempted to receive an AUX_CHAIN_IND PDU but was not successful or
 * received it but was unable to store the data.
 *
 * Where the event being reported used a legacy advertising PDU, the Controller shall set
 * the Event_Type to the value specified in Table 7.1.

 * The Periodic_Advertising_Interval parameter shall be set to zero when no periodic
 * advertising exists as part of the advertising set.
 *
 * The Direct_Address_Type and Direct_Address parameters shall contain the TargetA
 * address in the advertising PDU for directed advertising event types (bit 2 = 1). These
 * parameters shall be ignored for undirected advertising event types (bit 2 = 0). If
 * the TargetA address is a resolvable private address that the Controller successfully
 * resolved, then the value of Direct_Address_Type shall depend on the value of the
 * Own_Address_Type parameter of the command that set the extended scan parameters.
 * Direct_Address shall be set as follows:
 *
 * • If Direct_Address_Type equals 0x02, then Direct_Address shall be set to either the
 *   TargetA field in the received advertisement or to the public device address of the
 *   scanning device.
 * • If Direct_Address_Type equals 0x03, then Direct_Address shall be set to either
 *   the TargetA field in the received advertisement or to the address set by the
 *   HCI_LE_Set_Random_Address command.
 * • Otherwise Direct_Address shall be set to the TargetA field in the received
 *   advertisement.
 *
 * When multiple advertising packets are used to complete a single advertising report
 * (e.g., a packet containing an ADV_EXT_IND PDU combined with one containing an
 * AUX_ADV_IND PDU), the RSSI parameter shall be set based on the last packet
 * received and the TX_Power parameter shall be based on the last packet of the current
 * advertisement or scan response received that contains a TxPower field. If there is no
 * packet containing a TxPower field, then TX_Power shall be set to 0x7F. However, if
 * an event has been sent with a TX_Power value other than 0x7F and a Data_Status of
 * "incomplete, more data to come", and if no subsequent PDU with a TxPower field has
 * been received, then subsequent events may instead have a TX_Power value of 0x7F.
 *
 * If the Controller receives an AUX_CHAIN_IND with no AdvData, it should send the
 * report (or the last report if it has split the data) immediately without waiting for any
 * subsequent AUX_CHAIN_IND PDUs.

 *
 * The Reference_Power_Level parameter is expressed in dBm and is described in [Vol 6]

 * Table 7.2: Allowed combinations of done status
 *
 * The Num_Antenna_Paths parameter indicates the number of antenna paths used for
 * CS tone exchanges.
 *
 * The Num_Steps_Reported parameter indicates the number of CS steps for which
 * results are reported. The Step_Mode[i] parameter indicates the CS mode for each CS
 * step, and the Step_Channel[i] parameter indicates the channel used for each CS step.
 * A Controller may return a value 0 when a subevent is aborted.
 *
 * The Step_Data_Length[i] and Step_Data[i] parameters indicate the reported data
 * that varies based on the CS mode and the CS role of the local device. When
 * Step_Data_Length[i] is set to zero, it indicates that the Step may have been aborted for

 *
 * This command is used to read the maximum size of the data portion of ACL data
 * packets and isochronous data packets sent from the Host to the Controller. The Host
 * shall fragment the data transmitted to the Controller according to these values so that
 * the HCI ACL Data packets and HCI ISO Data packets will contain data up to this size
 * (“data” includes optional fields in the HCI ISO Data packet, such as ISO_SDU_Length).
 * The HCI_LE_Read_Buffer_Size command also returns the total number of HCI LE ACL
 * Data packets and isochronous data packets that can be stored in the data buffers of the
 * Controller. The HCI_LE_Read_Buffer_Size command shall be issued by the Host before
 * it sends any data to an LE Controller (see Section 4.1.1). If the Controller supports HCI
 * ISO Data packets, it shall return non-zero values for the ISO_Data_Packet_Length and
 * Total_Num_ISO_Data_Packets parameters.
 *
 * If the Controller returns a length value of zero for ACL data packets, the Host shall use
 * the HCI_Read_Buffer_Size command to determine the size of the data buffers (shared
 * between BR/EDR and LE transports).
 *
 * Note: Both the HCI_Read_Buffer_Size command and the HCI_LE_Read_Buffer_Size
 * command may return buffer length and number of packets parameter values that are
 * nonzero. This allows a Controller to offer different buffers and number of buffers for
 * BR/EDR data packets and LE data packets.
 *
 * The LE_ACL_Data_Packet_Length parameter shall be used to determine the maximum
 * size of the L2CAP PDU fragments that are contained in ACL data packets, and which
 * are transferred from the Host to the Controller to be broken up into packets by the Link
 * Layer. The Total_Num_LE_ACL_Data_Packets parameter contains the total number of
 * HCI ACL Data packets that can be stored in the data buffers of the Controller. The Host
 * determines how to divide the buffers between different connection handles.
 *
 * The ISO_Data_Packet_Length parameter shall be used to determine the maximum
 * size of the SDU fragments that are contained in isochronous data packets, and which
 * are transferred from the Host to the Controller. The Total_Num_ISO_Data_Packets

 * in the data buffers of the Controller. The Host determines how to divide the buffers
 * between different connection handle(s).

 *
 * If directed advertising is performed, i.e. when Advertising_Type is set to 0x01

 *
 * The HCI_LE_Set_Scan_Enable command is used to start and stop scanning for legacy
 * PDUs (but not extended PDUs, even if the device supports extended advertising).
 * Scanning is used to discover advertising devices nearby.
 *
 * The Filter_Duplicates parameter controls whether the Link Layer should filter out
 * duplicate advertising reports (Filtering_Enabled) to the Host, or if the Link Layer should
 * generate advertising reports for each packet received (Filtering_Disabled). See [Vol 6]
 * Part B, Section 4.4.3.5. If LE_Scan_Enable is set to 0x00 then Filter_Duplicates shall be
 * ignored.
 *
 * If LE_Scan_Enable is set to 0x01, the scanning parameters' Own_Address_Type
 * parameter is set to 0x00 or 0x02, and the device does not have a public address,

 * parameter is set to 0x01 or 0x03, and the random address for the device has not
 * been initialized using the HCI_LE_Set_Random_Address command, the Controller shall
 * return the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the LE_Scan_Enable parameter is set to 0x01 and scanning is already enabled, any
 * change to the Filter_Duplicates setting shall take effect.
 *
 * Disabling scanning when it is disabled has no effect.
 *

/** @brief LE Create Connection.
 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v6.0,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.8.12
 *
 * The HCI_LE_Create_Connection command is used to create an ACL connection, with
 * the local device in the Central role, to a connectable advertiser.
 *
 * If a connection is created with the local device in the Peripheral role while this command
 * is pending, then this command remains pending.
 *
 * The LE_Scan_Interval and LE_Scan_Window parameters are recommendations from
 * the Host on how long (LE_Scan_Window) and how frequently (LE_Scan_Interval) the
 * Controller should scan. The LE_Scan_Window parameter shall be set to a value smaller
 * or equal to the value set for the LE_Scan_Interval parameter. If both are set to the same
 * value, scanning should run continuously.
 *
 * The Initiator_Filter_Policy is used to determine whether the Filter Accept List is used.
 * If the Filter Accept List is not used, the Peer_Address_Type and the Peer_Address
 * parameters specify the address type and address of the advertising device to connect
 * to.
 *
 * Peer_Address_Type parameter indicates the type of address used in the connectable
 * advertisement sent by the peer. The Host shall not set Peer_Address_Type
 * to either 0x02 or 0x03 if both the Host and the Controller support
 * the HCI_LE_Set_Privacy_Mode command. If a Controller that supports the
 * HCI_LE_Set_Privacy_Mode command receives the HCI_LE_Create_Connection
 * command with Peer_Address_Type set to either 0x02 or 0x03, it may use either device
 * privacy mode or network privacy mode for that peer device.
 * Peer_Address parameter indicates the Peer’s Public Device Address, Random (static)
 * Device Address, Non-Resolvable Private Address or Resolvable Private Address
 * depending on the Peer_Address_Type parameter.
 *
 * Own_Address_Type parameter indicates the type of address being used in the
 * connection request packets.
 *
 * The Connection_Interval_Min and Connection_Interval_Max parameters define the
 * minimum and maximum allowed connection interval. The Connection_Interval_Min
 * parameter shall not be greater than the Connection_Interval_Max parameter.
 *
 * The Max_Latency parameter defines the maximum allowed Peripheral latency (see [Vol
 * 6] Part B, Section 4.5.1).
 *
 * The Supervision_Timeout parameter defines the link supervision timeout for the
 * connection. The Supervision_Timeout in milliseconds shall be larger than (1 +
 * Max_Latency) × Connection_Interval_Max × 2, where Connection_Interval_Max is
 * given in milliseconds. (See [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.2).
 *
 * The Min_CE_Length and Max_CE_Length parameters provide the Controller with the
 * expected minimum and maximum length of the connection events. The Min_CE_Length
 * parameter shall be less than or equal to the Max_CE_Length parameter. The Controller
 * is not required to use these values.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command when another HCI_LE_Create_Connection command
 * is pending in the Controller, the Controller shall return the error code Command
 * Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the local device is already connected to the same device address as the advertiser
 * (including two different Resolvable Private Addresses that resolve to the same IRK),
 * then the Controller shall return an error which should use the error code Connection
 * Already Exists (0x0B).
 *
 * If the Own_Address_Type parameter is set to 0x00 and the device does not have a
 * public address, the Controller should return an error code which should be Invalid HCI
 * Command Parameters (0x12).

 * If the Own_Address_Type parameter is set to 0x01 and the random address for the
 * device has not been initialized using the HCI_LE_Set_Random_Address command, the
 * Controller shall return the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the Own_Address_Type parameter is set to 0x02, the Initiator_Filter_Policy parameter
 * is set to 0x00, the Controller's resolving list did not contain a matching entry, and the
 * device does not have a public address, the Controller should return an error code which
 * should be Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).

 * is set to 0x01, and the device does not have a public address, the Controller should
 * return an error code which should be Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the Own_Address_Type parameter is set to 0x03, the Initiator_Filter_Policy
 * parameter is set to 0x00, the Controller's resolving list did not contain a matching

 * • If extended advertising PDU types are being used (bit 4 = 0), then the advertisement
 *   shall not be both connectable and scannable (bits 0 and 1 must not both be set to 1)
 *   and high duty cycle directed connectable advertising (≤ 3.75 ms advertising interval)
 *   shall not be used (bit 3 = 0).
 *
 * If the Advertising_Event_Properties parameter does not describe an event type
 * supported by the Controller, contains an invalid bit combination, or specifies a type
 * that does not support advertising data when the advertising set already contains some,
 * the Controller shall return the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * The Own_Address_Type parameter shall be ignored for undirected anonymous
 * advertising (bit 2 = 0 and bit 5 = 1).
 *
 * If Directed advertising is selected, the Peer_Address_Type and Peer_Address shall be
 * valid and the Advertising_Filter_Policy parameter shall be ignored.
 *
 * The Primary_Advertising_Interval_Min parameter shall be less than or equal to the
 * Primary_Advertising_Interval_Max parameter. The Primary_Advertising_Interval_Min
 * and Primary_Advertising_Interval_Max parameters should not be the same value so
 * that the Controller can choose the best advertising interval given other activities.
 *
 * For high duty cycle connectable directed advertising event type (ADV_DIRECT_IND),
 * the Primary_Advertising_Interval_Min and Primary_Advertising_Interval_Max
 * parameters are not used and shall be ignored.
 *
 * If the primary advertising interval range provided by the Host
 * (Primary_Advertising_Interval_Min, Primary_Advertising_Interval_Max) does not
 * overlap with the advertising interval range supported by the Controller, then the
 * Controller shall return the error code Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11).
 *
 * The Primary_Advertising_Channel_Map is a bit field that indicates the advertising
 * channel indices that shall be used when transmitting advertising packets. At least one
 * channel bit shall be set in the Primary_Advertising_Channel_Map parameter.
 *
 * The Own_Address_Type parameter specifies the type of address being used in
 * the advertising packets. For random addresses, the address is specified by the
 * HCI_LE_Set_Advertising_Set_Random_Address command.
 *
 * If Own_Address_Type equals 0x02 or 0x03, the Peer_Address parameter contains
 * the peer’s Identity Address and the Peer_Address_Type parameter contains the
 * peer’s Identity Type (i.e., 0x00 or 0x01). These parameters are used to locate the
 * corresponding local IRK in the resolving list; this IRK is used to generate their own
 * address used in the advertisement.
 *
 * The Advertising_TX_Power parameter indicates the maximum power level at which the
 * advertising packets are to be transmitted on the advertising physical channels. The
 * Controller shall choose a power level lower than or equal to the one specified by the
 * Host.
 *
 * The Primary_Advertising_PHY parameter indicates the PHY on which the advertising
 * packets are transmitted on the primary advertising physical channel. If legacy
 * advertising PDUs are being used, the Primary_Advertising_PHY shall indicate the LE
 * 1M PHY. The Secondary_Advertising_PHY parameter indicates the PHY on which the
 * advertising packets are be transmitted on the secondary advertising physical channel.
 * If the Host specifies a PHY that is not supported by the Controller, including a value
 * that is reserved for future use, it should return the error code Unsupported Feature or
 * Parameter Value (0x11). If Constant Tone Extensions are enabled for the advertising set
 * and Secondary_Advertising_PHY specifies a PHY that does not allow Constant Tone
 * Extensions, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the Primary_Advertising_PHY indicates the LE Coded PHY, then the
 * Primary_Advertising_PHY_Options shall indicate the Host's preference or requirement
 * concerning coding scheme. Otherwise, Primary_Advertising_PHY_Options shall
 * be ignored. If the Secondary_Advertising_PHY indicates the LE Coded PHY,
 * then the Secondary_Advertising_PHY_Options shall indicate the Host's preference
 * or requirement concerning coding scheme (including for periodic advertising).
 * Otherwise, Secondary_Advertising_PHY_Options shall be ignored. If the Host
 * specifies that it requires a specific coding (i.e., value 0x03 or 0x04) in the
 * Primary_Advertising_PHY_Options or Secondary_Advertising_PHY_Options and the
 * Controller supports the LE Feature (Advertising Coding Selection) but is currently
 * unable to provide all the required settings, then the Controller shall return the error
 * code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * The Secondary_Advertising_Max_Skip parameter is the maximum number of
 * advertising events that can be skipped before the AUX_ADV_IND can be sent.
 *
 * The Advertising_SID parameter specifies the value to be transmitted in the Advertising
 * SID subfield of the ADI field of the Extended Header of those advertising physical
 * channel PDUs that have an ADI field. If the advertising set only uses PDUs that do not
 * contain an ADI field, Advertising_SID shall be ignored.
 *
 * The Scan_Request_Notification_Enable parameter indicates whether the Controller
 * shall send notifications upon the receipt of a scan request PDU that is in response
 * to an advertisement from the specified advertising set that contains its device address
 * and is from a scanner that is allowed by the advertising filter policy.
 *
 * The Controller shall set the Selected_TX_Power parameter to the transmit power that
 * it will use for transmitting the advertising packets for the specified advertising set. The
 * Controller shall only change this value if requested by the Host. If the radiated power
 * level will vary between packets (e.g., because of frequency-dependent properties of the
 * transmitter) then the value should be the best estimate of the maximum power used.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command when advertising is enabled for the specified
 * advertising set, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the Host issues this command when periodic advertising is enabled for the specified
 * advertising set and connectable, scannable, legacy, or anonymous advertising is
 * specified, the Controller shall return the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters
 * (0x12).
 *
 * If periodic advertising is enabled for the advertising set and the
 * Secondary_Advertising_PHY parameter does not specify the PHY currently being
 * used for the periodic advertising, the Controller shall return the error code Command
 * Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the Advertising_Handle does not identify an existing advertising set and the Controller
 * is unable to support a new advertising set at present, the Controller shall return the error
 * code Memory Capacity Exceeded (0x07).
 *
 * If the advertising set already contains advertising data or scan response data, extended
 * advertising is being used, and the length of the data is greater than the maximum that
 * the Controller can transmit within the longest possible auxiliary advertising segment
 * consistent with the parameters, the Controller shall return the error code Packet Too
 * Long (0x45). If advertising on the LE Coded PHY, the S=8 coding shall be assumed
 * unless the current advertising parameters require the use of S=2 for an advertising
 * physical channel, in which case the S=2 coding shall be assumed for that advertising
 * physical channel.
 *
 * If the Controller does not support the LE Feature (Advertising Coding
 * Selection) and the Host does not set both Primary_Advertising_PHY_Options and

/** @brief LE Set Extended Advertising Enable.
 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v6.0,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.8.56
 *
 * The HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Advertising_Enable command is used to request the
 * Controller to enable or disable one or more advertising sets using the advertising
 * sets identified by the Advertising_Handle[i] parameter. The Controller manages the
 * timing of advertisements in accordance with the advertising parameters given in the
 * HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Advertising_Parameters command. The Num_Sets parameter
 * is the number of advertising sets contained in the parameter arrays. If Enable and
 * Num_Sets are both set to 0x00, then all advertising sets are disabled.
 *
 * The Controller shall only start an advertising event when the corresponding
 * advertising set is enabled. The Controller shall continue advertising until all advertising
 * sets have been disabled. An advertising set shall be disabled when the Host
 * issues an HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Advertising_Enable command with the Enable
 * parameter set to 0x00 (Advertising is disabled), a connection is created using
 * that advertising set, the duration specified in the Duration[i] parameter expires, or
 * the number of extended advertising events transmitted for the set exceeds the
 * Max_Extended_Advertising_Events[i] parameter.
 *
 * The Duration[i] parameter indicates the duration for which that advertising set is
 * enabled. The duration begins at the start of the first advertising event of this advertising
 * set. The Controller should not start an extended advertising event that it cannot
 * complete within the duration.
 *
 * If the advertising is high duty cycle connectable directed advertising, then Duration[i]
 * shall be less than or equal to 1.28 seconds and shall not be equal to 0.
 *
 * The Max_Extended_Advertising_Events[i] parameter, if non-zero, indicates the
 * maximum number of extended advertising events that shall be sent prior to disabling
 * the extended advertising set even if the Duration[i] parameter has not expired.
 *
 * Duration[i] and Max_Extended_Advertising_Events[i] shall be ignored when Enable is
 * set to 0x00.
 * If the HCI_LE_Set_Extended_Advertising_Enable command is sent again for an
 * advertising set while that set is enabled, the timer used for the duration and the number
 * of events counter are reset and any change to the random address shall take effect.
 *
 * Disabling the advertising set identified by the Advertising_Handle[i] parameter does not
 * disable any periodic advertising associated with that set.
 *
 * Disabling an advertising set that is already disabled has no effect.
 *
 * If the same advertising set is identified by more than one entry in the
 * Advertising_Handle[i] arrayed parameter, then the Controller shall return the error code
 * Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the advertising set corresponding to the Advertising_Handle[i] parameter does not
 * exist, then the Controller shall return the error code Unknown Advertising Identifier
 * (0x42).
 *
 * The remainder of this section only applies if Enable is set to 0x01.
 *
 * If Num_Sets is set to 0x00, the Controller shall return the error code Invalid HCI
 * Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the advertising set contains partial advertising data or partial scan response data, the
 * Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the advertising set uses scannable extended advertising PDUs and no scan response
 * data is currently provided, the Controller shall return the error code Command
 * Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the advertising set uses connectable extended advertising PDUs and the advertising
 * data in the advertising set will not fit in the AUX_ADV_IND PDU, the Controller shall
 * return the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * Note: The maximum amount of data that will fit in the PDU depends on which options
 * are selected and on the maximum length of PDU that the Controller is able to transmit.
 *
 * If extended advertising is being used and the length of any advertising data or of
 * any scan response data is greater than the maximum that the Controller can transmit
 * within the longest possible auxiliary advertising segment consistent with the chosen
 * advertising interval, the Controller shall return the error code Packet Too Long (0x45). If
 * advertising on the LE Coded PHY, the S=8 coding shall be assumed unless the current
 * advertising parameters require the use of S=2 for an advertising physical channel, in
 * which case the S=2 coding shall be assumed for that advertising physical channel.
 * If the advertising set's Own_Address_Type parameter is set to 0x00 and the device
 * does not have a public address, the Controller should return an error code which should
 * be Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the advertising set's Own_Address_Type parameter is set to 0x01 and the
 * random address for the advertising set has not been initialized using the
 * HCI_LE_Set_Advertising_Set_Random_Address command, the Controller shall return
 * the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the advertising set's Own_Address_Type parameter is set to 0x02, the Controller's
 * resolving list did not contain a matching entry, and the device does not have a public

 * If the Max_Extended_Advertising_Events[i] parameter is set to a value other than 0x00,

 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v6.0,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.8.61
 *
 * The HCI_LE_Set_Periodic_Advertising_Parameters command is used by the Host to
 * set the parameters for periodic advertising.
 *
 * The Advertising_Handle parameter identifies the advertising set whose periodic
 * advertising parameters are being configured. If the corresponding advertising set does
 * not already exist, then the Controller shall return the error code Unknown Advertising
 * Identifier (0x42).
 *
 * The Periodic_Advertising_Interval_Min parameter shall be less than or equal to the
 * Periodic_Advertising_Interval_Max parameter. The Periodic_Advertising_Interval_Min
 * and Periodic_Advertising_Interval_Max parameters should not be the same value to
 * enable the Controller to determine the best advertising interval given other activities.
 *
 * If the periodic advertising interval range provided by the Host (Periodic_Advertising_-
 * Interval_Min, Periodic_Advertising_Interval_Max) does not overlap with the periodic
 * advertising interval range supported by the Controller, then the Controller shall return
 * an error which should use the error code Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value
 * (0x11).
 *
 * The Periodic_Advertising_Properties parameter indicates which fields should be
 * included in the advertising packet.
 *
 * The Num_Subevents parameter identifies the number of subevents that shall be
 * transmitted for each periodic advertising event. If the Num_Subevents parameter value
 * is 0x00, then the Periodic Advertising does not have responses and the Controller
 * shall ignore the Subevent_Interval, Response_Slot_Delay, Response_Slot_Spacing,
 * and Num_Response_Slots parameters. If Num_Subevents is greater than 0, then the
 * Periodic Advertising is PAwR.
 *
 * The Subevent_Interval parameter identifies the time between the subevents
 * of PAwR. The Subevent_Interval shall be less than or equal to the
 * Periodic_Advertising_Interval_Min divided by the Num_Subevents of the advertising
 * set. If Num_Subevents is set to 1, then the Controller shall ignore Subevent_Interval
 * and uses of Subevent_Interval in the next two paragraphs shall be replaced by
 * Periodic_Advertising_Interval_Max.
 *
 * The Response_Slot_Delay parameter identifies the time between the start of the
 * advertising packet at the start of a subevent and the start of the first response slot.
 * The Response_Slot_Delay shall be less than the Subevent_Interval.
 *
 * The Response_Slot_Spacing parameter identifies the time between the start of two
 * consecutive response slots. The Response_Slot_Spacing shall be less than or equal
 * to 10 × (Subevent_Interval − Response_Slot_Delay) ÷ Num_Response_Slots. If the
 * Num_Response_Slots parameter is set to 1, then the Controller shall ignore the
 * Response_Slot_Spacing parameter.
 *
 * The Num_Response_Slots parameter identifies the number of response slots in a
 * subevent.
 *
 * If the advertising set identified by the Advertising_Handle specified scannable,
 * connectable, legacy, or anonymous advertising, the Controller shall return the error
 * code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the Host issues this command when periodic advertising is enabled for the specified
 * advertising set, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the Advertising_Handle does not identify an advertising set that is already configured
 * for periodic advertising and the Controller is unable to support more periodic advertising
 * at present, the Controller shall return the error code Memory Capacity Exceeded (0x07).
 *
 * If the advertising set already contains periodic advertising data and the length of the
 * data is greater than the maximum that the Controller can transmit within a periodic
 * advertising interval of Periodic_Advertising_Interval_Max, the Controller shall return the
 * error code Packet Too Long (0x45). If advertising on the LE Coded PHY, the S=8 coding
 * shall be assumed unless the current advertising parameters require the use of S=2 for
 * an advertising physical channel, in which case the S=2 coding shall be assumed for that
 * advertising physical channel.

 * return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If periodic advertising is currently enabled for the specified advertising set, the
 * Controller shall use the new data in subsequent periodic advertising events for this
 * advertising set. If a periodic advertising event is in progress when this command is
 * issued, the Controller may use the old or new data for that event.

 * If periodic advertising is currently disabled for the specified advertising set, the data
 * shall be kept by the Controller and used once periodic advertising is enabled for that
 * set. The data shall be discarded when the advertising set is removed.
 *
 * Only the significant part of the periodic advertising data should be transmitted in the
 * advertising packets as defined in [Vol 3] Part C, Section 11.
 *
 * The Host may set the periodic advertising data in one or more operations using the

 *
 * If Operation is 0x04 and:
 *
 * • periodic advertising is currently disabled for the advertising set;
 * • the periodic advertising set contains no data; or

 *
 * If a connection is created with the local device in the Peripheral role while this command
 * is pending, then this command remains pending.
 *
 * The Advertising_Handle parameter is used to identify the periodic advertising train.
 *
 * The Subevent parameter is used to identify the subevent where a connection
 * request shall be initiated from a periodic advertising train. The Host may use
 * this subevent whether or not the Controller has requested data for it using the
 * HCI_LE_Periodic_Advertising_Subevent_Data_Request event.
 *
 * The Advertising_Handle and Subevent parameters shall be set to 0xFF if these

 *
 * If the Advertising_Handle and Subevent parameters are set to values other than 0xFF,
 * then the Initiator_Filter_Policy, Scan_Interval[i], and Scan_Window[i] parameters shall
 * be ignored.
 *
 * The Initiator_Filter_Policy parameter is used to determine whether the Filter Accept List
 * is used and whether to process decision PDUs and other advertising PDUs. If the Filter
 * Accept List is not used, the Peer_Address_Type and the Peer_Address parameters
 * specify the address type and address of the advertising device to connect to for
 * advertisements not using decision PDUs. If Initiator_Filter_Policy is set to 0x03, then
 * devices on the Filter Accept List shall still be processed using the decision instructions
 * (see Section 7.8.145).
 *
 * The Own_Address_Type parameter indicates the type of address being used in the
 * connection request packets.
 *
 * The Peer_Address_Type parameter indicates the type of address used in the
 * connectable advertisement sent by the peer.
 *
 * The Peer_Address parameter indicates the Peer’s Public Device Address, Random
 * (static) Device Address, Non-Resolvable Private Address, or Resolvable Private
 * Address depending on the Peer_Address_Type parameter.
 *
 * The Initiating_PHYs parameter indicates the PHY(s) on which the advertising packets
 * should be received on the primary advertising physical channel and the PHYs for
 * which connection parameters have been specified. The Host may enable one or more
 * initiating PHYs. If the Host specifies a PHY that is not supported by the Controller,
 * including a bit that is reserved for future use, the latter should return the error code
 * Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11). If the Host sets Advertising_Handle to
 * a value other than 0xFF and does not include the PHY used for the specified periodic
 * advertising train in Initiating_PHYs, the Controller shall return an error which should use
 * the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12). The array elements of the
 * arrayed parameters are ordered in the same order as the set bits in the Initiating_PHYs
 * parameter, starting from bit 0. The number of array elements is determined by the

 * is received and a connection request is sent on one PHY, scanning on any other PHYs
 * is terminated.
 *
 * The Scan_Interval[i] and Scan_Window[i] parameters are recommendations from the

 * of the scan is implementation specific. If the requested scan cannot be supported by
 * the implementation, the Controller shall return the error code Invalid HCI Command
 * Parameters (0x12). If bit 1 is set in Initiating_PHYs, the values for the LE 2M PHY shall
 * be ignored.
 *
 * The Connection_Interval_Min[i] and Connection_Interval_Max[i] parameters define the
 * minimum and maximum allowed connection interval. The Connection_Interval_Min[i]
 * parameter shall not be greater than the Connection_Interval_Max[i] parameter.
 * The Max_Latency[i] parameter defines the maximum allowed Peripheral latency (see
 * [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.1).
 *
 * The Supervision_Timeout[i] parameter defines the link supervision timeout for the
 * connection. The Supervision_Timeout[i] in milliseconds shall be larger than (1 +
 * Max_Latency[i]) × Connection_Interval_Max[i] × 2, where Connection_Interval_Max[i]
 * is given in milliseconds (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.2).
 *
 * The Min_CE_Length[i] and Max_CE_Length[i] parameters provide the Controller
 * with the expected minimum and maximum length of the connection events. The
 * Min_CE_Length[i] parameter shall be less than or equal to the Max_CE_Length[i]
 * parameter. The Controller is not required to use these values.
 *
 * Where the connection is made on a PHY whose bit is not set in the

 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v6.0,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.8.67
 *
 * The HCI_LE_Periodic_Advertising_Create_Sync command is used to synchronize with
 * a periodic advertising train from an advertiser and begin receiving periodic advertising
 * packets.
 *
 * This command may be issued whether or not scanning is enabled and scanning may
 * be enabled and disabled (see the LE Set Extended Scan Enable command) while
 * this command is pending. However, synchronization can only occur when scanning is
 * enabled. While scanning is disabled, no attempt to synchronize will take place.
 *
 * The Options parameter is used to determine whether the Periodic Advertiser List is
 * used, whether HCI_LE_Periodic_Advertising_Report events for this periodic advertising
 * train are initially enabled or disabled, and whether duplicate reports are filtered or not. If
 * the Periodic Advertiser List is not used, the Advertising_SID, Advertiser Address_Type,
 * and Advertiser Address parameters specify the periodic advertising device to listen to;
 * otherwise they shall be ignored.
 *
 * The Advertising_SID parameter, if used, specifies the value that shall match the
 * Advertising SID subfield in the ADI field of the received advertisement for it to be used
 * to synchronize.
 *
 * The Skip parameter specifies the maximum number of consecutive periodic advertising
 * events that the receiver may skip after successfully receiving a periodic advertising
 * packet.
 *
 * The Sync_Timeout parameter specifies the maximum permitted time between
 * successful receives. If this time is exceeded, synchronization is lost.
 *
 * The Sync_CTE_Type parameter specifies whether to only synchronize to periodic
 * advertising with certain types of Constant Tone Extension (a value of 0 indicates that
 * the presence or absence of a Constant Tone Extension is irrelevant). If the periodic
 * advertising has the wrong type of Constant Tone Extension then:
 *
 * • If bit 0 of Options is set, the Controller shall ignore this address and SID and continue
 *   to search for other periodic advertisements.
 * • Otherwise, the Controller shall cancel the synchronization with the error code
 *   Unsupported Remote Feature (0x1A).
 *
 * If the periodic advertiser changes the type of Constant Tone Extension after the scanner
 * has synchronized with the periodic advertising, the scanner's Link Layer shall remain
 * synchronized.
 *
 * If the Host sets all the non-reserved bits of the Sync_CTE_Type parameter to 1, the
 * Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * Irrespective of the value of the Skip parameter, the Controller should stop skipping
 * packets before the Sync_Timeout would be exceeded.

 * Advertiser_Address_Type, and Advertiser_Address the same as those of a periodic
 * advertising train that the Controller is already synchronized to, the Controller shall return
 * the error code Connection Already Exists (0x0B).
 *
 * If the Host issues this command and the Controller has insufficient resources to handle
 * any more periodic advertising trains, the Controller shall return the error code Memory
 * Capacity Exceeded (0x07).

 * should use the error code Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11).
 *
 * If bit 1 of the Options parameter is set to 1 and the Controller does not support

 *
 * The HCI_LE_Write_RF_Path_Compensation command is used to indicate the RF path

 * a net RF path loss. The RF_TX_Path_Compensation_Value parameter shall be used

 * events, Advertising physical channel PDUs, and Link Layer Control PDUs using the
 * following equation:
 *
 * Radiative Tx power level = Tx power level at RF transceiver output +
 * RF_TX_Path_Compensation_Value
 *
 * For example, if the Tx power level is +4 (dBm) at RF transceiver output and the
 * RF_TX_Path_Compensation_Value is -1.5 (dB), the radiative Tx power level is +4+
 * (-1.5) = 2.5 (dBm).

 * calculate the RSSI value reported to the Host using the following equation:
 *
 * Rx power level at RF transceiver input = Rx power level at antenna +
 * RF_RX_Path_Compensation_Value
 *
 * For example, if the Rx power level is -45 (dBm) at RF transceiver input and the
 * RF_RX_Path_Compensation_Value is -3.2 (dB), the Rx power level at antenna is -41.8
 * (dBm).
 *
 * The default values for the RF path compensation are vendor-specific.
 *
 * This command can be issued at any time. If this command is issued during an ongoing
 * over-the-air RF activity, the Controller may apply the Tx path compensation immediately
 * or after a vendor-specific delay.
 *
 * The Controller shall apply a change to the Tx path compensation value either by leaving
 * the power at the transceiver output unchanged and altering the radiative Tx power level
 * or by altering the power at the transceiver output to maintain any previously chosen

/** @brief LE Set CIG Parameters.
 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v6.0,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.8.97
 *
 * The HCI_LE_Set_CIG_Parameters command is used by a Central’s Host to create a
 * CIG and to set the parameters of one or more CISes that are associated with a CIG in
 * the Controller.
 *
 * The CIG_ID parameter identifies a CIG. This parameter is allocated by the Central’s
 * Host and passed to the Peripheral’s Host through the Link Layers during the process
 * of creating a CIS. If the CIG_ID does not exist, then the Controller shall first create a
 * new CIG. Once the CIG is created (whether through this command or previously), the
 * Controller shall modify or add CIS configurations in the CIG that is identified by the
 * CIG_ID and update all the parameters that apply to the CIG.
 *
 * The SDU_Interval_C_To_P parameter specifies the time interval between the start of
 * consecutive SDUs from the Central’s Host for all the CISes in the CIG. This parameter
 * shall be ignored for all CISes that are unidirectional from Peripheral to Central.
 *
 * The SDU_Interval_P_To_C parameter specifies the time interval between the start
 * of consecutive SDUs from the Peripheral’s Host for all the CISes in the CIG. This
 * parameter shall be ignored for all CISes that are unidirectional from Central to
 * Peripheral.
 * The Worst_Case_SCA parameter shall be the worst-case sleep clock accuracy of all
 * the Peripherals that will participate in the CIG. The Host should get the sleep clock
 * accuracy from all the Peripherals before issuing this command. If the Host cannot get
 * the sleep clock accuracy from all the Peripherals, it shall set the Worst_Case_SCA
 * parameter to zero.
 *
 * Note: The Worst_Case_SCA parameter can be used by the Link Layer to better allow
 * for clock drift when scheduling the CISes in the CIG. For example, if a CIS has
 * more than two subevents, the Link Layer of the Central can set the timing of the
 * subevents such that the worst case drift in the Peripheral's clock will not exceed 2 ×
 * Sub_Interval. This prevents the Peripheral from synchronizing its timing to the wrong
 * subevent (adjacent subevents cannot be on the same channel).
 *
 * The Packing parameter indicates the preferred method of arranging subevents
 * of multiple CISes. The subevents can be arranged in Sequential or Interleaved
 * arrangement (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.14.2). This is a recommendation to the
 * Controller which the Controller may ignore. This parameter shall be ignored when there
 * is only one CIS in the CIG.
 *
 * The Framing parameter indicates the format of the CIS Data PDUs of the specified
 * CISes' framing mode (see [Vol 6] Part G, Section 2) that the Host is requesting for the
 * CIG. The Controller may use any framing mode permitted by [Vol 6] Part G, Table 2.1
 * but shall set the framing mode of all the CISes in the CIG to the same mode. This
 * overrides any framing mode previously set for the CIG.
 *
 * The Max_Transport_Latency_C_To_P parameter contains the maximum transport
 * latency from the Central to the Peripheral, in milliseconds, as described in [Vol 6] Part
 * G, Section 3.2.1 and [Vol 6] Part G, Section 3.2.2. This parameter shall be ignored for
 * all CISes that are unidirectional from Peripheral to Central.
 *
 * The Max_Transport_Latency_P_To_C parameter contains the maximum transport
 * latency from the Peripheral to the Central, in milliseconds, as described in [Vol 6] Part
 * G, Section 3.2.1 and [Vol 6] Part G, Section 3.2.2. This parameter shall be ignored for
 * all CISes that are unidirectional from Central to Peripheral.
 *
 * The CIS_Count parameter indicates the number of CIS configurations being modified or
 * added by this command. The Controller shall set the CIS_Count return parameter equal
 * to this.
 *
 * The CIS_ID[i] parameter identifies a CIS and is set by the Central’s Host and passed to
 * the Peripheral’s Host through the Link Layers during the process of establishing a CIS.
 *
 * The Max_SDU_C_To_P[i] parameter identifies the maximum size of an SDU from the
 * Central’s Host. If the CIS is unidirectional from Peripheral to Central, this parameter
 * shall be set to 0. If a CIS configuration that is being modified has a data path set in
 * the Central to Peripheral direction and the Host has specified that Max_SDU_C_To_P[i]
 * shall be set to zero, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed
 * (0x0C).
 *
 * The Max_SDU_P_To_C[i] parameter identifies the maximum size of an SDU from the
 * Peripheral’s Host. If the CIS is unidirectional from Central to Peripheral, this parameter
 * shall be set to 0. If a CIS configuration that is being modified has a data path set in
 * the Peripheral to Central direction and the Host has specified that Max_SDU_P_To_C[i]
 * shall be set to zero, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed
 * (0x0C).
 *
 * The PHY_C_To_P[i] parameter identifies which PHY to use for transmission from the
 * Central to the Peripheral. The Host shall set at least one bit in this parameter and the
 * Controller shall pick a PHY from the bits that are set.
 *
 * The PHY_P_To_C[i] parameter identifies which PHY to use for transmission from the
 * Peripheral to the Central. The Host shall set at least one bit in this parameter and the
 * Controller shall pick a PHY from the bits that are set.
 *
 * The RTN_C_To_P[i] (Retransmission Number) parameter contains the number of times
 * that a CIS Data PDU should be retransmitted from the Central to Peripheral before
 * being acknowledged or flushed (irrespective of which CIS events the retransmission
 * opportunities occur in). If the CIS is unidirectional from Peripheral to Central, this
 * parameter shall be ignored. Otherwise, this parameter is a recommendation to the
 * Controller which the Controller may ignore.
 *
 * The RTN_P_To_C[i] parameter contains the number of times that a CIS Data PDU
 * should be retransmitted from the Peripheral to Central before being acknowledged or
 * flushed (irrespective of which CIS events the retransmission opportunities occur in). If
 * the CIS is unidirectional from Central to Peripheral, this parameter shall be ignored.
 * Otherwise, this parameter is a recommendation to the Controller which the Controller
 * may ignore.
 *
 * In each direction, if the Controller satisfies the recommendation, then every PDU
 * will have at least RTN+1 opportunities for transmission (assuming that the initial
 * transmission of that PDU happens at the earliest allowed subevent). The RTN value
 * indicates that the Host is recommending that the Controller selects a combination of CIS
 * parameters that satisfy the inequality:
 *
 * NSE × FT − NSE ÷ BN × BN−1 ≥ RTN + 1
 *
 * If the Status parameter is non-zero, then the state of the CIG and its CIS configurations
 * shall not be changed by the command. If the CIG did not already exist, it shall not be
 * created.
 * If Status is zero, then the Controller shall set each Connection_Handle[i] to the
 * connection handle corresponding to the CIS configuration specified in CIS_ID[i]. If the
 * same CIS_ID is being reconfigured, the same connection handle shall be returned.
 *
 * The connection handle of a CIS shall refer to the CIS when it exists and to the
 * configuration of the CIS stored in a CIG when the CIG exists but the CIS with that
 * CIS_ID does not.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command when the CIG is not in the configurable state, the
 * Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the Host attempts to create a CIG or set parameters that exceed the maximum
 * supported resources in the Controller, the Controller shall return the error code Memory
 * Capacity Exceeded (0x07).
 *
 * If the Host attempts to set CIS parameters that exceed the maximum supported
 * connections in the Controller, the Controller shall return the error code Connection Limit
 * Exceeded (0x09).
 *
 * If the Host sets, in the PHY_C_To_P[i] or PHY_P_To_C[i] parameters, a bit for a PHY
 * that the Controller does not support, including a bit that is reserved for future use, the
 * Controller shall return the error code Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11).
 *
 * If the Controller does not support asymmetric PHYs and the Host sets PHY_C_To_P[i]
 * to a different value than PHY_P_To_C[i], the Controller shall return the error code
 * Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11).
 *
 * If the Host specifies an invalid combination of CIS parameters, the Controller shall
 * return the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12) or the error code
 * Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11); it should return the error code Invalid
 * HCI Command Parameters (0x12).

/** @brief LE Set CIG Parameters Test.
 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v6.0,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.8.98
 *
 * The HCI_LE_Set_CIG_Parameters_Test command should only be used for testing
 * purposes.
 *
 * The command is used by a Central’s Host to create a CIG and to set the parameters of
 * one or more CISes that are associated with a CIG in the Controller.
 *
 * The CIG_ID parameter identifies a CIG. This parameter is allocated by the Central’s
 * Host and passed to the Peripheral’s Host through the Link Layers during the process
 * of creating a CIS. If the CIG_ID does not exist, then the Controller shall first create a
 * new CIG. Once the CIG is created (whether through this command or previously), the
 * Controller shall modify or add CIS configurations in the CIG that is identified by the
 * CIG_ID and update all the parameters that apply to the CIG.
 *
 * The SDU_Interval_C_To_P parameter specifies the time interval of periodic SDUs from
 * the Central’s Host.
 * The SDU_Interval_P_To_C parameter specifies the time interval of periodic SDUs from
 * the Peripheral’s Host.
 *
 * The FT_C_To_P parameter identifies the maximum time for a payload from the Central
 * to Peripheral to be transmitted and re-transmitted, after which it is flushed (see [Vol 6]
 * Part B, Section 4.5.13.5). This parameter is expressed in multiples of ISO_Interval.
 *
 * The FT_P_To_C parameter identifies the maximum time for a payload from the
 * Peripheral to Central to be transmitted and re-transmitted, after which it is flushed
 * (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.13.5). This parameter is expressed in multiples of
 * ISO_Interval.
 *
 * The ISO_Interval parameter specifies the time between two consecutive CIS anchor
 * points.
 *
 * The CIS_Count parameter contains the number of CIS configurations being added or
 * modified by this command. The Controller shall set the CIS_Count return parameter
 * equal to this.
 *
 * The CIS_ID[i] parameter identifies the CIS and is set by the Central’s Host and passed
 * to the Peripheral’s Host through the Link Layers during the process of establishing a
 * CIS.
 *
 * The Worst_Case_SCA parameter is the worst-case sleep clock accuracy of all the
 * Peripherals that will participate in the CIG. The Host should get the sleep clock
 * accuracy from all the Peripherals before issuing this command. In case the Host cannot
 * get the sleep clock accuracy from all the Peripherals, it shall set the Worst_Case_SCA
 * parameter to zero.
 *
 * Note: The Worst_Case_SCA parameter can be used by the Link Layer to better allow
 * for clock drift when scheduling the CISes in the CIG. For example, if a CIS has
 * more than two subevents, the Link Layer of the Central can set the timing of the
 * subevents such that the worst case drift in the Peripheral's clock will not exceed 2 ×
 * Sub_Interval. This prevents the Peripheral from synchronizing its timing to the wrong
 * subevent (adjacent subevents cannot be on the same channel).
 *
 * The Packing parameter is used to indicate the preferred method of arranging subevents
 * of multiple CISes. The subevents can be arranged in Sequential or Interleaved
 * arrangement. This is a recommendation to the Controller which it may ignore. This
 * parameter shall be ignored when there is only one CIS in the CIG.
 *
 * The Framing parameter specifies the framing mode (see [Vol 6] Part G, Section 2) that
 * the Controller shall use for all the CISes in the CIG. This overrides any framing mode
 * previously set for the CIG.
 *
 * The CIS_ID[i] parameter is used to identify a CIS.
 * The NSE[i] parameter identifies the maximum number of subevents for each CIS in a
 * CIG event.
 *
 * The Max_SDU_C_To_P[i] parameter identifies the maximum size of SDU from the
 * Central’s Host. If the CIS is unidirectional from Peripheral to Central, this parameter
 * shall be set to 0. If a CIS configuration that is being modified has a data path set in
 * the Central to Peripheral direction and the Host has specified that Max_SDU_C_To_P[i]
 * shall be set to zero, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed
 * (0x0C). The minimum value of the Max_SDU_Size parameter in the ISO Transmit Test
 * mode when the Payload_Type = 1 or 2 shall be 4 octets.
 *
 * The Max_SDU_P_To_C[i] parameter identifies the maximum size of SDU from the
 * Peripheral’s Host. If the CIS is unidirectional from Central to Peripheral, this parameter
 * shall be set to 0. If a CIS configuration that is being modified has a data path set in
 * the Peripheral to Central direction and the Host has specified that Max_SDU_P_To_C[i]
 * shall be set to zero, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed
 * (0x0C).The minimum value of the Max_SDU parameter in the ISO Transmit Test mode
 * when the Payload_Type = 1 or 2 shall be 4 octets.
 *
 * The Max_PDU_C_To_P[i] parameter identifies the maximum size PDU from the Central
 * to Peripheral.
 *
 * The Max_PDU_P_To_C[i] parameter identifies the maximum size PDU from the
 * Peripheral to Central.
 *
 * The PHY_C_To_P[i] parameter identifies the PHY to be used for transmission of
 * packets from the Central to the Peripheral. The Host shall set only one bit in this
 * parameter and the Controller shall use the PHY set by the Host.
 *
 * The PHY_P_To_C[i] parameter identifies the PHY to be used for transmission of
 * packets from the Peripheral to the Central. The Host shall set only one bit in this
 * parameter and the Controller shall use the PHY set by the Host.
 *
 * The BN_C_To_P[i] parameter identifies the burst number for Central to Peripheral (see
 * [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.13). If the CIS is unidirectional from Peripheral to Central, this
 * parameter shall be set to zero.
 *
 * The BN_P_To_C[i] parameter identifies the burst number for Peripheral to Central (see
 * [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.13). If the CIS is unidirectional from Central to Peripheral, this
 * parameter shall be set to zero.
 *
 * If the Status parameter is non-zero, then the state of the CIG and its CIS configurations
 * shall not be changed by the command. If the CIG did not already exist, it shall not be
 * created.
 * If Status is zero, then the Controller shall set Connection_Handle[i] to the connection
 * handle corresponding to the CIS configuration specified in CIS_ID[i]. If the same CIS_ID
 * is being reconfigured, the same connection handle shall be returned.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command when the CIG is not in the configurable state, the
 * Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the Host attempts to create a CIG or set parameters that exceed the maximum
 * supported resources in the Controller, the Controller shall return the error code Memory
 * Capacity Exceeded (0x07).
 *
 * If the Host attempts to set CIS parameters that exceed the maximum supported
 * connections in the Controller, the Controller shall return the error code Connection Limit
 * Exceeded (0x09).
 *
 * If the Host attempts to set an invalid combination of CIS parameters, the Controller
 * shall return the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12) or the error code
 * Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11); it should return the error code Invalid
 * HCI Command Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the Host sets, in the PHY_C_To_P[i] or PHY_P_To_C[i] parameters, a bit for a PHY
 * that the Controller does not support, including a bit that is reserved for future use, the
 * Controller shall return the error code Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11).
 *
 * If the Controller does not support asymmetric PHYs and the Host sets PHY_C_To_P[i]
 * to a different value than PHY_P_To_C[i], the Controller shall return the error code
 * Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11).

 *
 * The CIS_Connection_Handle[i] parameter specifies the connection handle
 * corresponding to the configuration of the CIS to be created and whose configuration
 * is already stored in a CIG.
 *
 * The ACL_Connection_Handle[i] parameter specifies the connection handle of
 * the ACL connection associated with each CIS to be created. The list of
 * the ACL_Connection_Handles shall be in the same order as the list of
 * the CIS_Connection_Handles e.g., CIS_Connection_Handle[1] will connect to the
 * Peripheral associated with the ACL_Connection_Handle[1].
 *
 * If this command is issued on the Central before the devices have performed the
 * Feature Exchange procedure, then the Controller shall complete that procedure before
 * initiating the Connected Isochronous Stream Creation procedure (see [Vol 6] Part B,
 * Section 5.1.15).
 *
 * If any ACL_Connection_Handle[i] is not the handle of an existing ACL connection or any
 * CIS_Connection_Handle[i] is not the handle of a CIS or CIS configuration, the Controller
 * shall return the error code Unknown Connection Identifier (0x02).
 *
 * If the Host attempts to create a CIS that has already been created, the Controller shall
 * return the error code Connection Already Exists (0x0B).
 *
 * If two different elements of the CIS_Connection_Handle arrayed parameter identify the

 * (0x12).
 *
 * If the Host issues this command before all the HCI_LE_CIS_Established events from
 * the previous use of the command have been generated, the Controller shall return the

 * If the Host issues this command on an ACL_Connection_Handle where the Controller is
 * the Peripheral, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).

 * command.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command when the Connected Isochronous Stream (Host

 *
 * If the Host specified an invalid combination of parameters in the
 * HCI_LE_Set_CIG_Parameters or HCI_LE_Set_CIG_Parameters_Test command that

 *
 * Note: If an error is reported in the HCI_Command_Status event, it means that no

 *
 * The BN (Burst Number) parameter contains the number of new payloads for each BIS
 * in a BIS event.
 *
 * The IRC (Immediate Repetition Count) parameter contains the number of times the

 *
 * If the Controller cannot create all BISes of the BIG or if Num_BIS exceeds the maximum
 * value supported by the Controller, it shall return the error code Connection Rejected due

 * a Controller should listen to for data payloads in each interval for a BIS. The Controller
 * may select any of the subevents to listen to.
 *
 * The BIG_Sync_Timeout parameter specifies the maximum permitted time between
 * successful receptions of BIS PDUs. If this time is exceeded, synchronization is lost.
 * When the Controller establishes synchronization and if the BIG_Sync_Timeout set by
 * the Host is less than 6 × ISO_Interval, the Controller shall set the timeout to 6 ×

 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v6.0,

 *
 * The HCI_LE_Setup_ISO_Data_Path command is used to identify and create the
 * isochronous data path between the Host and the Controller for a CIS, CIS configuration,
 * or BIS identified by the Connection_Handle parameter. This command can also be used
 * to configure a codec for each data path. When a connection is created no data paths
 * are set up for that connection. When the command has completed successfully, data
 * shall be allowed to flow over the specified path in the specified direction irrespective of
 * the state of the other direction or any other path.
 *
 * The input and output directions are defined from the perspective of the Controller, so
 * "input" refers to data flowing from the Host to the Controller.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command more than once for the same Connection_Handle
 * and direction before issuing the HCI_LE_Remove_ISO_Data_Path command for that
 * Connection_Handle and direction, the Controller shall return the error code Command
 * Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the Host issues this command for a CIS on a Peripheral before it has issued the
 * HCI_LE_Accept_CIS_Request command for that CIS, then the Controller shall return
 * the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * The Data_Path_Direction parameter specifies the direction for which the data path is
 * being configured.
 *
 * The Data_Path_ID parameter specifies the data transport path used. When set to 0x00,
 * the data path shall be over the HCI transport. When set to a value in the range
 * 0x01 to 0xFE, the data path shall use a vendor-specific transport interface (e.g., a
 * PCM interface) with logical transport numbers. The meanings of these logical transport
 * numbers are vendor-specific.
 * If the Host issues this command for a vendor-specific data transport path that has
 * not been configured, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed
 * (0x0C).
 *
 * If the Host attempts to set a data path with a Connection Handle that does not exist or
 * that is not for a CIS, CIS configuration, or BIS, the Controller shall return the error code
 * Unknown Connection Identifier (0x02).
 *
 * If the Host attempts to set an output data path using a connection handle that is for an
 * Isochronous Broadcaster, for an input data path on a Synchronized Receiver, or for a
 * data path for the direction on a unidirectional CIS where BN is set to 0, the Controller
 * shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * The Codec_ID parameter specifies the coding format used over the air.
 *
 * When Data_Path_Direction is set to 0x00 (input), the Controller_Delay parameter
 * specifies the delay at the data source from the reference time of an SDU
 * to the CIG reference point (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.14.1) or BIG
 * anchor point (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.4.6.4). When Data_Path_Direction
 * is set to 0x01 (output), Controller_Delay specifies the delay from the
 * SDU_Synchronization_Reference to the point in time at which the Controller begins
 * to transfer the corresponding data to the data path interface. The Host should use the
 * HCI_Read_Local_Supported_Controller_Delay command to obtain a suitable value for
 * Controller_Delay.
 *
 * Note: Controller vendors may provide additional guidance to the Host on how to
 * select a suitable Controller_Delay value from the range of values provided by the
 * HCI_Read_Local_Supported_Controller_Delay command for various configurations of
 * the data path interface.
 *
 * The Codec_Configuration parameter specifies codec-specific configuration information
 * for the specified direction.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command with Codec_Configuration_Length non-zero and
 * Codec_ID set to transparent air mode, the Controller shall return the error code Invalid
 * HCI Command Parameters (0x12).

 * The Own_Address_Type parameter specifies the type of address being used in
 * the advertising packets. For random addresses, the address is specified by the
 * HCI_LE_Set_Advertising_Set_Random_Address command.
 *
 * If Own_Address_Type equals 0x02 or 0x03, the Peer_Address parameter contains
 * the peer’s Identity Address and the Peer_Address_Type parameter contains the
 * peer’s Identity Type (i.e., 0x00 or 0x01). These parameters are used to locate the
 * corresponding local IRK in the resolving list; this IRK is used to generate their own
 * address used in the advertisement.
 *
 * The Advertising_TX_Power parameter indicates the maximum power level at which the
 * advertising packets are to be transmitted on the advertising physical channels. The
 * Controller shall choose a power level lower than or equal to the one specified by the
 * Host.
 *
 * The Primary_Advertising_PHY parameter indicates the PHY on which the advertising
 * packets are transmitted on the primary advertising physical channel. If legacy
 * advertising PDUs are being used, the Primary_Advertising_PHY shall indicate the LE
 * 1M PHY. The Secondary_Advertising_PHY parameter indicates the PHY on which the
 * advertising packets are be transmitted on the secondary advertising physical channel.
 * If the Host specifies a PHY that is not supported by the Controller, including a value
 * that is reserved for future use, it should return the error code Unsupported Feature or
 * Parameter Value (0x11). If Constant Tone Extensions are enabled for the advertising set
 * and Secondary_Advertising_PHY specifies a PHY that does not allow Constant Tone
 * Extensions, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the Primary_Advertising_PHY indicates the LE Coded PHY, then the
 * Primary_Advertising_PHY_Options shall indicate the Host's preference or requirement
 * concerning coding scheme. Otherwise, Primary_Advertising_PHY_Options shall
 * be ignored. If the Secondary_Advertising_PHY indicates the LE Coded PHY,
 * then the Secondary_Advertising_PHY_Options shall indicate the Host's preference
 * or requirement concerning coding scheme (including for periodic advertising).
 * Otherwise, Secondary_Advertising_PHY_Options shall be ignored. If the Host
 * specifies that it requires a specific coding (i.e., value 0x03 or 0x04) in the
 * Primary_Advertising_PHY_Options or Secondary_Advertising_PHY_Options and the
 * Controller supports the LE Feature (Advertising Coding Selection) but is currently
 * unable to provide all the required settings, then the Controller shall return the error
 * code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * The Secondary_Advertising_Max_Skip parameter is the maximum number of
 * advertising events that can be skipped before the AUX_ADV_IND can be sent.
 *
 * The Advertising_SID parameter specifies the value to be transmitted in the Advertising
 * SID subfield of the ADI field of the Extended Header of those advertising physical
 * channel PDUs that have an ADI field. If the advertising set only uses PDUs that do not
 * contain an ADI field, Advertising_SID shall be ignored.
 *
 * The Scan_Request_Notification_Enable parameter indicates whether the Controller
 * shall send notifications upon the receipt of a scan request PDU that is in response
 * to an advertisement from the specified advertising set that contains its device address
 * and is from a scanner that is allowed by the advertising filter policy.
 *
 * The Controller shall set the Selected_TX_Power parameter to the transmit power that
 * it will use for transmitting the advertising packets for the specified advertising set. The
 * Controller shall only change this value if requested by the Host. If the radiated power
 * level will vary between packets (e.g., because of frequency-dependent properties of the
 * transmitter) then the value should be the best estimate of the maximum power used.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command when advertising is enabled for the specified
 * advertising set, the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the Host issues this command when periodic advertising is enabled for the specified
 * advertising set and connectable, scannable, legacy, or anonymous advertising is
 * specified, the Controller shall return the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters
 * (0x12).
 *
 * If periodic advertising is enabled for the advertising set and the
 * Secondary_Advertising_PHY parameter does not specify the PHY currently being
 * used for the periodic advertising, the Controller shall return the error code Command
 * Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * If the Advertising_Handle does not identify an existing advertising set and the Controller
 * is unable to support a new advertising set at present, the Controller shall return the error
 * code Memory Capacity Exceeded (0x07).
 *
 * If the advertising set already contains advertising data or scan response data, extended
 * advertising is being used, and the length of the data is greater than the maximum that
 * the Controller can transmit within the longest possible auxiliary advertising segment
 * consistent with the parameters, the Controller shall return the error code Packet Too
 * Long (0x45). If advertising on the LE Coded PHY, the S=8 coding shall be assumed
 * unless the current advertising parameters require the use of S=2 for an advertising
 * physical channel, in which case the S=2 coding shall be assumed for that advertising
 * physical channel.
 *
 * If the Controller does not support the LE Feature (Advertising Coding
 * Selection) and the Host does not set both Primary_Advertising_PHY_Options and
 * Secondary_Advertising_PHY_Options to zero, the Controller shall return the error code
 * Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11).

 * shall be transmitted only once.
 *
 * When using more than one instance of this command to provide data, the Host may
 * provide the data in any order. For example, if providing data for subevents 0 and 1 in
 * separate commands, the first command can contain either subevent.
 *
 * The Advertising_Handle parameter identifies the advertising set whose periodic
 * advertising subevent data is being set. If the corresponding advertising set does not
 * already exist, then the Controller shall return the error code Unknown Advertising
 * Identifier (0x42). If the corresponding advertising set exists but has not been configured
 * for Periodic Advertising with Responses, then the Controller shall return the error code
 * Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * The Num_Subevents_With_Data parameter is the number of subevent data contained
 * in the parameter arrays.
 *
 * The Subevent[i] parameter identifies the subevent of the PAwR that is being set.
 * If the Host provides a subevent value that is outside of the range of subevents
 * requested using the HCI_LE_Periodic_Advertising_Subevent_Data_Request event,
 * then the Controller shall return the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C). If two
 * elements of the array specify the same subevent, then the Controller shall return an

 *
 * The Response_Slot_Start[i] and Response_Slot_Count[i] parameters identify the
 * starting response slot and the number of response slots that are expected to be used in
 * this subevent.
 * Note: If the Host does not expect any responses in a subevent, then it can
 * set Response_Slot_Count[i] for that subevent to 0. If the Host expects one or
 * more responses in a future subevent, then it can set Response_Slot_Start[i] and
 * Response_Slot_Count[i] for that subevent appropriately either in the same command
 * or a subsequent use of this command.
 *
 * The Subevent_Data_Length[i] parameter determines the length of the Subevent_Data
 * that is significant.
 *
 * The Subevent_Data[i] parameter contains the advertising data to be transmitted in
 * the subevent of the advertising set. If the combined data length is greater than the
 * maximum that the Controller can transmit within the current subevent interval, then all
 * data shall be discarded and the Controller shall return the error code Packet Too Long

 *
 * If the Subevent_Data cannot be transmitted because, for example, the subevent where

 *
 * If the Host sends this command without the Controller having issued an

 * command is also used to create an ACL connection between a periodic advertiser and a
 * synchronized device.
 *
 * If a connection is created with the local device in the Peripheral role while this command
 * is pending, then this command remains pending.
 *
 * The Advertising_Handle parameter is used to identify the periodic advertising train.
 *
 * The Subevent parameter is used to identify the subevent where a connection
 * request shall be initiated from a periodic advertising train. The Host may use
 * this subevent whether or not the Controller has requested data for it using the
 * HCI_LE_Periodic_Advertising_Subevent_Data_Request event.
 *
 * The Advertising_Handle and Subevent parameters shall be set to 0xFF if these
 * parameters are not used. If the Host sets one but not both of these to 0xFF, then the
 * Controller shall return an error which should use the error code Invalid HCI Command
 * Parameters (0x12).
 *
 * If the Advertising_Handle and Subevent parameters are set to values other than 0xFF,
 * then the Initiator_Filter_Policy, Scan_Interval[i], and Scan_Window[i] parameters shall
 * be ignored.
 *
 * The Initiator_Filter_Policy parameter is used to determine whether the Filter Accept List
 * is used and whether to process decision PDUs and other advertising PDUs. If the Filter
 * Accept List is not used, the Peer_Address_Type and the Peer_Address parameters
 * specify the address type and address of the advertising device to connect to for
 * advertisements not using decision PDUs. If Initiator_Filter_Policy is set to 0x03, then
 * devices on the Filter Accept List shall still be processed using the decision instructions
 * (see Section 7.8.145).
 *
 * The Own_Address_Type parameter indicates the type of address being used in the
 * connection request packets.
 *
 * The Peer_Address_Type parameter indicates the type of address used in the
 * connectable advertisement sent by the peer.
 *
 * The Peer_Address parameter indicates the Peer’s Public Device Address, Random
 * (static) Device Address, Non-Resolvable Private Address, or Resolvable Private
 * Address depending on the Peer_Address_Type parameter.
 *
 * The Initiating_PHYs parameter indicates the PHY(s) on which the advertising packets
 * should be received on the primary advertising physical channel and the PHYs for
 * which connection parameters have been specified. The Host may enable one or more
 * initiating PHYs. If the Host specifies a PHY that is not supported by the Controller,
 * including a bit that is reserved for future use, the latter should return the error code
 * Unsupported Feature or Parameter Value (0x11). If the Host sets Advertising_Handle to
 * a value other than 0xFF and does not include the PHY used for the specified periodic
 * advertising train in Initiating_PHYs, the Controller shall return an error which should use
 * the error code Invalid HCI Command Parameters (0x12). The array elements of the
 * arrayed parameters are ordered in the same order as the set bits in the Initiating_PHYs
 * parameter, starting from bit 0. The number of array elements is determined by the
 * number of bits set in the Initiating_PHYs parameter. When a connectable advertisement
 * is received and a connection request is sent on one PHY, scanning on any other PHYs
 * is terminated.
 *
 * The Scan_Interval[i] and Scan_Window[i] parameters are recommendations from the
 * Host on how long (Scan_Window[i]) and how frequently (Scan_Interval[i]) the Controller
 * should scan (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.3); however the frequency and length
 * of the scan is implementation specific. If the requested scan cannot be supported by
 * the implementation, the Controller shall return the error code Invalid HCI Command
 * Parameters (0x12). If bit 1 is set in Initiating_PHYs, the values for the LE 2M PHY shall
 * be ignored.
 *
 * The Connection_Interval_Min[i] and Connection_Interval_Max[i] parameters define the
 * minimum and maximum allowed connection interval. The Connection_Interval_Min[i]
 * parameter shall not be greater than the Connection_Interval_Max[i] parameter.
 * The Max_Latency[i] parameter defines the maximum allowed Peripheral latency (see
 * [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.1).
 *
 * The Supervision_Timeout[i] parameter defines the link supervision timeout for the
 * connection. The Supervision_Timeout[i] in milliseconds shall be larger than (1 +
 * Max_Latency[i]) × Connection_Interval_Max[i] × 2, where Connection_Interval_Max[i]
 * is given in milliseconds (see [Vol 6] Part B, Section 4.5.2).
 *
 * The Min_CE_Length[i] and Max_CE_Length[i] parameters provide the Controller
 * with the expected minimum and maximum length of the connection events. The
 * Min_CE_Length[i] parameter shall be less than or equal to the Max_CE_Length[i]
 * parameter. The Controller is not required to use these values.
 *
 * Where the connection is made on a PHY whose bit is not set in the
 * Initiating_PHYs parameter, the Controller shall use the Connection_Interval_Min[i],
 * Connection_Interval_Max[i], Max_Latency[i], Supervision_Timeout[i], Min_CE_Length[i],

 * (including two different Resolvable Private Addresses that resolve to the same IRK),
 * then the Controller shall return an error which should use the error code Connection
 * Already Exists (0x0B).

 * (0x11).
 *
 * The Periodic_Advertising_Properties parameter indicates which fields should be

 * is 0x00, then the Periodic Advertising does not have responses and the Controller
 * shall ignore the Subevent_Interval, Response_Slot_Delay, Response_Slot_Spacing,
 * and Num_Response_Slots parameters. If Num_Subevents is greater than 0, then the
 * Periodic Advertising is PAwR.

 * The Subevent_Interval parameter identifies the time between the subevents
 * of PAwR. The Subevent_Interval shall be less than or equal to the
 * Periodic_Advertising_Interval_Min divided by the Num_Subevents of the advertising
 * set. If Num_Subevents is set to 1, then the Controller shall ignore Subevent_Interval
 * and uses of Subevent_Interval in the next two paragraphs shall be replaced by
 * Periodic_Advertising_Interval_Max.
 *
 * The Response_Slot_Delay parameter identifies the time between the start of the
 * advertising packet at the start of a subevent and the start of the first response slot.
 * The Response_Slot_Delay shall be less than the Subevent_Interval.
 *
 * The Response_Slot_Spacing parameter identifies the time between the start of two
 * consecutive response slots. The Response_Slot_Spacing shall be less than or equal
 * to 10 × (Subevent_Interval − Response_Slot_Delay) ÷ Num_Response_Slots. If the
 * Num_Response_Slots parameter is set to 1, then the Controller shall ignore the
 * Response_Slot_Spacing parameter.
 *
 * The Num_Response_Slots parameter identifies the number of response slots in a
 * subevent.
 *

/** @brief LE CS Test.
 *
 * The description below is extracted from Core_v6.0,
 * Vol 4, Part E, Section 7.8.142
 *
 * This command is used to start a CS test where the Implementation Under Test (IUT)
 * is placed in the role of either the initiator or reflector. The first mode-0 channel in the
 * list is used as the starting channel for the test. At the beginning of any test, the IUT
 * in the reflector role shall listen on the first mode-0 channel until it receives the first
 * transmission from the initiator. Similarly, with the IUT in the initiator role, the tester
 * will start by listening on the first mode-0 channel and the IUT shall transmit on that
 * channel for the first half of the first CS step. Thereafter, the parameters of this command
 * describe the required transmit and receive behavior for the CS test.
 *
 * This command is used to schedule a single CS procedure that consists of one or more
 * CS subevents. After the channels contained in the Channel map or the Channel array in
 * case of an override have been used the number of times indicated by Channel_Map_-
 * Repetition to schedule CS steps, or the maximum number of allowed steps in a CS
 * procedure has been reached, or the maximum number of subevents indicated by
 * the Max_Num_Subevents parameter has been reached, or the maximum number of
 * allowed subevents in a CS procedure has been reached, the CS procedure will end.
 *
 * The Main_Mode_Type and the Sub_Mode_Type parameters indicate the CS modes to
 * be used during the CS procedure for the specified CS configuration.
 *
 * The Main_Mode_Repetition parameter indicates the number of main mode CS steps
 * repeated from the last CS subevent at the beginning of the current CS subevent.
 *
 * The Mode_0_Steps parameter indicates the number of mode-0 CS steps to be included
 * at the beginning of each CS subevent.
 *
 * The Role parameter indicates the CS role for the local Controller.
 *
 * The RTT_Type parameter indicates the RTT type and payload length to be used during
 * the CS procedure.
 *
 * The CS_SYNC_PHY parameter indicates the PHY to be used for CS_SYNC exchanges
 * during the CS procedure.
 *
 * The CS_SYNC_Antenna_Selection parameter indicates the antenna identifier to be
 * used for transmitting and receiving CS_SYNC packets.
 *
 * The Subevent_Len parameter indicates the maximum length of a CS subevent.
 *
 * The Subevent_Interval parameter indicates the gap between the start of consecutive
 * CS subevents. When Subevent_Interval is set to zero, the Subevent_Len parameter is
 * ignored, and only one CS subevent is executed in the CS test.
 *
 * The Max_Num_Subevents parameter indicates the maximum number of subevents
 * that are in the procedure. If Max_Num_Subevents is set to 0x00, then the
 * Max_Num_Subevents parameter is ignored.
 *
 * The Transmit_Power_Level parameter indicates the transmit power level used for the
 * CS procedure.
 * The T_IP1_Time, T_IP2_Time, T_FCS_Time, T_PM_Time, and T_SW_Time
 * parameters indicate the time durations used in CS steps as described in [Vol 6] Part
 * H, Section 4.3.
 *
 * The Tone_Antenna_Config_Selection parameter indicates the Antenna Configuration
 * Index used during antenna switching during the tone phases of CS steps as described
 * in [Vol 6] Part A, Section 5.3.
 *
 * The SNR_Control_Initiator parameter indicates the SNR control adjustment for the
 * CS_SYNC transmissions of the initiator.
 *
 * The SNR_Control_Reflector parameter indicates the SNR control adjustment for of the
 * CS_SYNC transmissions of the reflector.
 *
 * The DRBG_Nonce parameter specifies octets 14 and 15 of the initial value of the DRBG
 * nonce, VDRBG, used in calls to the random bit generation function described in [Vol 6]
 * Part E, Section 3.1.6. The remaining octets of the initial nonce value VDRBG are set to
 * 0x00. All octets of the initial temporal key KDRBG are set to 0x00. The most significant bit
 * of this parameter is stored in the most significant bit of the octet 14 of the DRBG nonce.
 * The least significant bit of this parameter is stored in the least significant bit of octet 15
 * of the DRBG nonce.
 *
 * The Channel_Map_Repetition field shall indicate the number of times the
 * Channel_Map is cycled through for non-mode-0 steps within a CS procedure. The
 * Channel_Map_Repetition field shall be greater than or equal to 1. The Channel_Map
 * content is selected based on the setting of the Override_Config bit 0 as described
 * below.
 *
 * The Override_Config parameter indicates which CS parameters are not derived from
 * the DRBG but determined from the Override_Parameters_Data parameter in this
 * command.
 *
 * If the Override_Config bit 2 corresponding to CS submode insertion is not set, then the
 * number of main mode CS steps to be executed before a submode CS step during the
 * CS procedure is determined using DRBG with following default values:
 *
 * • Min_Main_Mode_Steps: 6
 * • Max_Main_Mode_Steps: 10
 *
 * If the Override_Config bit 10 corresponding to the Stable Phase test is set, then
 * the procedure is replaced with the Stable Phase test as described in [Vol 6] Part F,
 * Section 2.4.
 * The Override_Parameters_Data is a variable sized object with a length indicated by
 * Override_Parameters_Length parameter whose contents are determined by the bits set
 * in the Override_Config parameter.
 *
 * An ongoing CS test can be stopped using the HCI_LE_CS_Test_End command (see
 * Section 7.8.143).
 *
 * The CS test is considered complete when all the results of the CS procedure initiated by
 * the CS test have been reported to the Host.
 *
 * If the Host issues this command when a CS test is already enabled using the
 * HCI_LE_CS_Test command and has not completed, then the Controller shall return
 * the error code Command Disallowed (0x0C).
 *
 * Event(s) generated (unless masked away):

 * This command dynamically modifies Bluetooth LE Tx power level at the antenna given a handle and a

 *

 * the controller with a high degree of flexibility. The Bluetooth LE link whose power is
 * set is identified based on a handle type and handle pair.
 *
 * The role/state defining input parameter is the Handle_Type, whereas its
 * corresponding handle is provided by the Handle input parameter. Note that
 * for Advertisements, the Handle input parameter is ignored in the case that
 * Advertising Extensions are not configured, whereas Advertising Sets are to be
 * identified by their corresponding Handle in case Advertising Extensions are
 * enabled.
 *
 * The desired transmitter power level for the selected link instance is inputted
 * as Tx_Power_Level. This value represents the actual power level fed to the antenna.
 * When a Front-End Module is used, gain values for the SoC and FEM are calculated
 * automatically to guarantee closest possible match to the value requested by the user
 * at the RF output. The power setup and control can be performed dynamically
 * without the need of restarting the advertiser and scanner role/states. In case
 * of connections, the Tx power changes take effect only if the connections are
 * in a connected state.
 *
 * The inputs Handle_Type and Handle are passed through as outputs to aid the
 * asynchronous service of the command as well. In addition, the command returns
 * also with the Selected_Tx_Power by the controller which addresses and corrects

 *
 * This command sets the parameters used in LE Power Control Request

 *
 * beta parameter is used to determine the weight of the previous average of RSSI values.
 * A higher value lowers how much the current RSSI weighs into the average, flattening peaks,
 * which also means the controller reacts slower on RSSI changes.
 * The average RSSI is calculated using an exponential weighted averaging in a
 * 12-bit fixed point fraction.
 * avg[n] = gamma * avg[n - 1] + (1 - gamma) * rssi[n]
 * Here, gamma equals beta/4096, and rssi[n] equals the current RSSI.
 * For example, for gamma to be 0.25, set the beta parameter in the command to 1024.
 *
 * Average RSSI and lower_limit parameter are used to calculate APR value the controller sends
 * in LL_POWER_CONTROL_RSP.
 *
 * When auto_enable parameter is set, the controller will keep average RSSI within
 * [lower_limit, upper_limit] bounds. When the average RSSI goes out of these bounds, the
 * controller will autonomously send LL_POWER_CONTROL_REQ requesting to adjust the
 * peer's TX power so average RSSI becomes either lower_target_rssi or upper_target_rssi.
 * The controller will not send such requests more often than specified by wait_period_ms parameter.
 * The wait_period_ms parameter is needed to not repeat send requests for transmit power change
 * without the remote having had the chance to react, as well as to avoid a busy controller.
 * This value should be set depending on needs.
 *
 * When apr_enable parameter is set, the controller will adjust local TX power according to
 * APR value received from the peer in LL_POWER_CONTROL_RSP and the apr_margin parameter.
 *
 * When this command is issued, the controller stores the parameters and
 * uses them for the subsequent LE Power Control Request procedures across all the connections.

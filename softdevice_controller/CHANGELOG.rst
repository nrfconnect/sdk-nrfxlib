All the notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

nRF Connect SDK v1.7.0
**********************

All the notable changes included in the |NCS| v1.7.0 release are documented in this section.

Added
=====

* Added ``SDC_CFG_TYPE_SCAN_BUFFER_CFG`` to allow the application to configure the number of scan buffers (DRGN-15899).
* Added ``SDC_CFG_TYPE_ADV_BUFFER_CFG`` to allow the application to configure the maximum advertising buffer size (DRGN-15661).

Changes
=========

* The ``Direct_Address_Type`` and the ``Direct_Address`` in extended advertising reports are updated to reflect the latest BLE specification.
  See Specification errata 14566 and 15752 (DRGN-15927).
* The scanner is now scheduling cooperatively when the scan window is equal to the scan interval.
  This improves the performance in the case of Bluetooth Mesh applications (DRGN-13146).
* Support for radio front-end module (FEM) in nRF53 Series, based on the :ref:`mpsl_fem` (DRGN-14908).
* The application must now call the APIs prefixed with ``sdc_support_`` before calling :c:func:`sdc_cfg_set` (DRGN-15899).

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where the scanner did not check that the scan window was smaller than the scan interval (DRGN-15586).
* Fixed an issue where the channel map provided by the "LE Host Set Channel Classification" HCI command was not always applied on the secondary advertising channels (DRGN-15695).
* Fixed an issue on the nRF53 Series where an assert could occur while scanning using legacy commands (DRGN-15852).
* Fixed an issue on the nRF53 Series where the scanner could generate corrupted advertising reports (DRGN-15852).
* Fixed an issue where the ``mpsl_tx_power_channel_map_set()`` API would not work on peripheral-only or central-only configurations (DRGN-16091).
* Fixed an issue where an assert may occur when legacy advertiser is used after "HCI LE Clear Advertising Sets" (DRGN-15993).
* Fixed an issue where an assert could occur when in LLPM mode and the connection interval was more than 1 ms (DRGN-16079).

nRF Connect SDK v1.6.0
**********************

All the notable changes included in the nRF Connect SDK v1.6.0 release are documented in this section.

Added
=====

* Added support for multiple advertising sets (DRGN-15426).
* Added radio front-end module (FEM) support, based on the :ref:`mpsl_fem` (nRF52 Series only) (DRGN-11059).
* Added support for the vendor-specific HCI command: Read Supported Vendor Specific Commands (DRGN-13763).
* Added support for the vendor-specific HCI command: Zephyr Read Key Hierarchy Roots (DRGN-13237).
* Added support for nRF5340, which was previously only supported for evaluation purposes (DRGN-8639).

Changes
=======

* Moved permanent limitations from the :ref:`nrf:known_issues` page to :ref:`softdevice_controller_limitations`.
* Increased the maximum supported radio output power on nRF53 Series devices from 0 dBm to 3 dBm.
  If the output power is above 0 dBm, NRF_VREQCTRL->VREGRADIO.VREQH is set (DRGN-15476).
* Reduced ``SDC_DEFAULT_RX_PACKET_COUNT`` from 3 to 2. Now the controller can achieve full throughput with only two RX buffers (DRGN-7696).
* Decoupled the controller from the random number generator (DRGN-12507).
  This functionality must now be provided by the user.
  The user must provide ``rand_prio_low_get()``, ``rand_prio_high_get()`` and ``rand_poll()`` through the newly introduced :c:func:`sdc_rand_source_register()`.
  These functions can be mapped to the Zephyr Entropy APIs:

    * ``rand_prio_low_get()`` <-> ``entropy_get_entropy_isr()`` (``*_isr()`` for nonblocking behavior)
    * ``rand_prio_high_get()`` <-> ``entropy_get_entropy_isr()``
    * ``rand_poll()`` <-> ``entropy_get_entropy()``

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where a slave connection could disconnect prematurely if there were scheduling conflicts with other roles (DRGN-15469).
* Fixed an issue where the channel map provided by the LE Host Set Channel Classification HCI command was not applied on the secondary advertising channels (DRGN-13594).
* The SoftDevice Controller can now be qualified on nRF52832 (DRGN-15382).
* Fixed an issue where setting a legacy advertiser's scan response data using extended advertising HCI commands corrupted the advertising data (DRGN-15465).
* Fixed an issue where, in rare cases, an assert could occur when receiving a packet as a slave.
  This could only occur after performing a data length procedure on Coded PHY (DRGN-15251).
* Fixed an issue where "HCI Read RSSI" would always return a Command Disallowed (0x0C) error code (DRGN-15310).
* Fixed an issue where setting radio output power using the vendor-specific HCI command Zephyr Write TX Power Level returned "Unsupported Feature or Parameter value (0x11)".
  Now the controller will select an output power level that is lower or equal to the one requested.
  The command returns success and the selected power level (DRGN-15369).
* Fixed an issue where an assert could occur when running an extended advertiser with maximum data length and minimum interval on Coded PHY.
  The assert would only occur if there were scheduling conflicts (DRGN-15694).
* Fixed an issue where a connectable or scannable advertiser ends with sending a packet without listening for the CONNECT_IND, AUX_CONNECT_REQ, and SCAN_REQ (DRGN-15484).
* Fixed an issue where an extended advertiser with limited duration may time out after the first primary channel packet in the last advertising event (DRGN-10367).
* Fixed an issue where the coding scheme provided by the LE Set PHY HCI Command was ignored after a remote initiated PHY procedure (DRGN-15531).
* Fixed an issue where the controller may still have pending events after :c:func:`sdc_hci_evt_get()` returns false.
  This would only occur if the host has masked out events (DRGN-15758).
* Fixed an issue where the extended scanner generated reports containing truncated data from a chained advertising PDU (DRGN-13338).

nRF Connect SDK v1.5.0
**********************

All the notable changes included in the nRF Connect SDK v1.5.0 release are documented in this section.

Added
=====

* Added :c:func:`sdc_support_ext_scan` which makes support for extended scanning configurable (DRGN-14902).
* Added :c:func:`sdc_support_ext_adv` which makes support for extended advertising configurable (DRGN-14914).
* Added support for the vendor-specific HCI command: Zephyr Read Chip Temperature (DRGN-13769).
* Added support for the vendor-specific HCI command: Zephyr Read Tx Power (DRGN-15250).

Changes
=======

* Renamed and reconfigured the libraries (DRGN-15118).
  Refer to the README for their corresponding supported feature sets.
  The new names are now:

    * ``libsoftdevice_controller_peripheral.a``
    * ``libsoftdevice_controller_central.a``
    * ``libsoftdevice_controller_multirole.a``

* All libraries are now compatible with all platforms within a given family (DRGN-15118).

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where the application could not immediately restart a connectable advertiser after a high duty cycle advertiser timed out (DRGN-13029).
* Fixed an issue where a directed advertiser used a resolvable address as the ``TargetA`` when the local device address was set to public or random device address (DRGN-13921).
* Fixed an issue where "HCI LE Set Extended Advertising Parameters" should have returned "Packet Too Long (0x45)" when the advertising set was already configured with data that was longer than it could fit within the advertising interval.
  Previously, the advertising data was cleared every time the advertising set was configured (DRGN-14008).
* Fixed an issue where the link would disconnect with reason "LMP Response Timeout (0x22)".
  This would occur if the "HCI LE Long Term Key Request event" was disabled and the slave received an encryption request (DRGN-15226).
* Fixed an issue where the LL control procedures LE start encryption and LE connection parameter update could not be initiated at the same time (DRGN-11963).
* Fixed an issue where the generation of QoS Connection event was not disabled after an HCI reset (DRGN-15291).

* ``hci_vs_cmd_zephyr_read_supported_commands_return_t`` was converted from a struct to a union.
  The content remains the same.
* The VersNr field in the LL_VERSION_IND packet now contains the value 0x0B to indicate Bluetooth Core Specification v5.2 compliance.
* The previously implemented Vendor Specific HCI command opcodes are now offset with 0x100.
* The previously implemented Vendor Specific HCI event codes are now offset with 0x80.
* When the controller receives an unknown command, it will raise "Command Status event" instead of "Command Complete event".
* When in slave latency, the controller now picks up data from the host for transmission earlier than it used to.
* In the LE Extended Advertising Report, the Direct Address Type values 0x02, 0x03, and 0xFE will only be used when the Scanning Filter Policy is equal to 0x02 or 0x03 and TargetA is a resolvable private address.
  If the address is resolved, then the Direct Address Type will contain the same value as the Own Address Type parameter of the command LE Set Extended Scan Parameters.
  This follows the Bluetooth Core Specification v5.2.
* On nRF53, the fix for Errata 16 is now applied.

nRF Connect SDK v1.2.0
**********************

All the notable changes included in the nRF Connect SDK v1.2.0 release are documented in this section.

Added
=====

* Added :c:func:`ble_controller_support_dle` which makes LE Data Length Extension support configurable.
* Added preliminary support for the S140 variant with the nRF5340 device.
  The Bluetooth LE Controller for nRF5340 supports the same feature set as its nRF52 Series counterpart.
  The following library has been added:

  * :file:`ble_controller/lib/cortex-m33+nodsp/soft-float/libble_controller_s140.a`

Changes
=======

* :c:func:`mpsl_init` is no longer called by :c:func:`ble_controller_init`.
  Application is therefore responsible for calling :c:func:`mpsl_init`, and it must be done before :c:func:`ble_controller_init` is called.
* Clock configuration parameters are now contained in :c:type:`mpsl_clock_lfclk_cfg_t` instead of :c:type:`nrf_lf_clock_cfg_t`, and must be provided to :c:func:`mpsl_init` instead of :c:func:`ble_controller_init`.
* Clock accuracy must now be specified in parts per million (ppm) instead of the previous enum value.
* The IRQ line to pend for low priority signal processing must be provided to :c:func:`mpsl_init` instead of :c:func:`ble_controller_init`.
* The application must call :c:func:`mpsl_low_priority_process` instead of :c:func:`ble_controller_low_prio_tasks_process` to process low priority signals.
* :c:func:`mpsl_uninit` is no longer called by :c:func:`ble_controller_disable`.
  Application must therefore call :c:func:`mpsl_uninit` after :c:func:`ble_controller_disable` to uninitialize MPSL.
* Interrupt handler APIs for the following peripherals are moved to MPSL: RADIO, RTC0, TIMER0, and POWER_CLOCK.
* High-frequency clock API (``ble_controller_hf_clock_...``) is removed.
  Use the corresponding API in MPSL instead.
* Temperature API (:c:func:`ble_controller_temp_get`) is removed.
  Use the corresponding API in MPSL instead.
* Timeslot API is removed.
  Use the corresponding API in MPSL instead.
* Version numbers have been removed from the libraries.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where the application could not immediately restart a connectable advertiser after a high duty cycle advertiser timed out.
* Fixed an issue where a control packet could be sent twice even after the packet was ACKed.
  This would only occur if the radio was forced off due to an unforeseen condition.
* Fixed an issue in HCI LE Set Extended Scan Enable where ``UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE`` was returned when duplicate filtering was enabled.
* Fixed an issue in HCI LE Set Advertising Parameters where ``UNSUPPORTED_FEATURE`` was returned when ``secondary_max_skip`` was set to a non-zero value.
  This issue occurred when sending a packet on either LE 1M or LE 2M PHY after receiving or transmitting a packet on
  LE Coded PHY.
  If this occurred while performing a Link Layer Control Procedure, the controller could end up retransmitting
  an ACKed packet, resulting in a disconnect.
* Fixed an issue where an assert could occur when receiving a packet with a CRC error after performing a data length procedure on Coded PHY.
* Fixed an issue where an assert occurred when setting a secondary PHY to 0 when using HCI LE Set Extended Advertising Parameters.
  This issue occurred when the advertising type was set to legacy advertising.

Added
=====

* Added support for nRF52833.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where :c:func:`hci_data_get` could return "No data available" when there was data available.
  This issue would only occur when connected to multiple devices at the same time.

nRF Bluetooth LE Controller 0.3.0-2.prealpha
********************************************

All the notable changes included in this release are documented in this section.

nRF Bluetooth LE Controller 0.3.0-1.prealpha
********************************************

All the notable changes included in this release are documented in this section.

Added
=====

* Increased the number of supported SoC and library combinations.
* Added API for estimating the dynamic memory usage returned by :c:func:`ble_controller_cfg_set`.
* Added a new header :file:`ble_controller_hci_vs.h` that exposes definitions of
  Vendor-Specific HCI commands and events.
* Added support for connection intervals less than the standard minimum of 7.5 ms.
  Note that this is a proprietary feature that is not Bluetooth compliant.
  This proprietary feature is named 'Low Latency Packet Mode (LLPM)'.
* Added support for enabling or disabling connection event length extension.
  When disabled, the maximum connection event length is set by ``ble_controller_cfg_event_length_t::event_length_us``.
  When enabled, the maximum connection event length is determined by the connection interval.
* Added support for generating QoS Connection event reports.
  When enabled, one report is generated with every connection event.
  The report contains information that can be used to change the Bluetooth LE channel map.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where the "HCI Read Local Supported Commands" command did not indicate support for the "HCI LE Set Privacy Mode" command.
* Fixed an issue where an ASSERT occurred when setting advertising data after HCI Reset without setting advertising parameters.
* Fixed an issue where an ASSERT occurred when writing to flash.
* Fixed an issue where a directed advertiser could time out without sending a packet on air.

Changes
=======
* The ``VersNr`` field in the LL_VERSION_IND packet now contains the value 0x0A to indicate Bluetooth Core Specification v5.1 compatibility.
* Bluetooth Core Specification Erratum #10750 is incorporated.
  The LE Data Length Change event will now be raised when switching to and from Coded PHY.
  On-air behavior has not changed.
* Bluetooth Core Specification Erratum #10818 is incorporated.
  The controller now allows HCI ACL data packets with a 0-length payload but does not transmit anything until receiving the next non-zero continuation fragment.
* Cleaned up invalid Doxygen comments.

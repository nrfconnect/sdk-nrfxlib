 * @brief The T4T emulation library interface
 *
 * This is the NFC Forum NDEF tag 4 type emulation library. It implements the
 * ISO14443-4A protocol (ISO-DEP) and additionally can emulate a read-writable
 * NDEF content. If the emulation of the NDEF content is not needed, the library
 * works in a raw mode where all APDUs are delivered to the user, who is then
 * responsible to generate a timely RPDU as a response.
 *
 * The sequence of initializing functions determines whether the NDEF emulation
 * will run or whether the raw mode is used.
 *
 *   - E.g. NDEF emulation
 *        * @ref nfc_t4t_setup
 *        * @ref nfc_t4t_ndef_rwpayload_set or
 @ref nfc_t4t_ndef_staticpayload_set
 *        * @ref nfc_t4t_emulation_start
 *        * ... running in NDEF emulation mode
 *   - E.g. RAW mode
 *        * @ref nfc_t4t_setup
 *        * @ref nfc_t4t_emulation_start
 *        * ... running in RAW emulation mode
 *
 * @note If you are using nRF52832 chip (in IC rev. Engineering B or
 * Engineering C) or if You are using nRF52840 chip (in IC rev. Engineering A,
 * B or C) library will use TIMER 4 to apply workarounds for the anomalies.

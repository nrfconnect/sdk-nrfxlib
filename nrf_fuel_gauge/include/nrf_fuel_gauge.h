 * @brief Algorithm for battery state-of-charge estimation ("fuel gauge").
 *
 * @details The algorithm determines the predicted state-of-charge (SOC) based on the following
 * data: specific model of the battery type used in the application along with
 * measurements of battery voltage, current, and temperature.
 * The SOC is a value between 0% and 100%.
 *
 * @note As this library has two variants, make sure to use a battery model that matches the
 * configured variant: primary cell (non-rechargeable) or secondary cell (rechargeable).
 *
 * @note Current and voltage measurements do not have to be made at a certain interval.
 *       However, the two values should be measured as closely as possible in time.

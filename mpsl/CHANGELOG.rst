All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

nRF Connect SDK v1.5.2
**********************

No changes in this release.

nRF Connect SDK v1.5.1
**********************

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where the clock configuration option :c:member:`mpsl_clock_lfclk_cfg_t.skip_wait_lfclk_started` did not work as expected with nRF5340 devices (DRGN-15223).

nRF Connect SDK v1.5.0
**********************

Added
=====

* Added a new signal to the MPSL timeslot: ``MPSL_TIMESLOT_SIGNAL_OVERSTAYED``.
  This signal is given to the application when a timeslot session is closed too late. (DRGN-14677)

* Added a new clock configuration option :c:member:`skip_wait_lfclk_started` in :c:struct:`mpsl_clock_lfclk_cfg_t`,
  which does not wait for the start of Low Frequency Clock. (DRGN-14204)

* Added macro MPSL_RESERVED_PPI_CHANNELS for a bit mask of (D)PPI channels
  reserved by MPSL (DRGN-13356).

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where Low Frequency Clock was configured incorrectly
  when the source configuration signal was set to either External Full swing or External Low swing. (DRGN-15064)

* Fixed an issue where MPSL waited for Low Frequency Clock to start even though it was configured not wait for it. (DRGN-15176)

nRF Connect SDK v1.4.0
**********************

Changes
=======

* Changed the timeslot implementation to support up to 8 concurrent sessions (DRGN-13952).
  It is now necessary to supply a timeslot context configuration using :c:func:`mpsl_timeslot_session_count_set`.
  All timeslot APIs now take a ``session_id`` as input.
  The session id is retrieved from :c:func:`mpsl_timeslot_session_open`.

* Added an API to use Front-End Modules, like the nRF21540 GPIO or a simple GPIO, with the protocols and an API to configure them using the application.
  Only the nRF52 series is supported.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue where the high frequency clock and ``TIMER0`` were not turned off during idle periods shorter than 9 ms (DRGN-14152).
  This increased the average power consumption.
  Such a case could occur when running a |BLE| connection with a connection interval of 7.5 ms.

Known Issues and limitations
============================

See the :ref:`nrf:known_issues` page in |NCS| for the list of known issues and limitations for this release.

nRF Connect SDK v1.3.0
**********************

Added
=====

* Added API for fetching build revision information.
* Added API to set a TX Power envelope.
  Protocols using MPSL will limit their TX power to a value equal to, or lower than, the provided value.
* Added support for using a low-swing and full-swing LF clock.
* The support for integrating an 802.15.4 driver is now improved.

Changes
=======

* Removed ``MPSL_RADIO_NOTIFICATION_DISTANCE_425US`` and replaced it by ``MPSL_RADIO_NOTIFICATION_DISTANCE_420US``.
* On nRF53, the fix for Errata 16 is now applied.
* The scheduling overhead of a timeslot event is reduced.

Bug fixes
=========

* Fixed an issue on nRF53 where an assert could occur when using a timeslot.

nRF Connect SDK v1.2.0
**********************

Added
=====

* Added a library version with preliminary support for the nRF5340 device.
  The feature set is the same as in the MPSL library for nRF52.
  The following library has been added:

:file:`soft-float/libmpsl.a`

Changes
=======

* Removed ``_nrf52`` from the MPSL library file names.
* Version numbers have been removed from the libraries.
* It is no longer allowed to call :c:func:`mpsl_init` if MPSL is already initialized.
* Clock configuration parameters for any stack that uses MPSL must be provided in :c:type:`mpsl_clock_lfclk_cfg_t` to :c:func:`mpsl_init`.
  This now also involves clock accuracy.
* Clock accuracy must be specified in parts per million (ppm).
* Renamed MPSL clock API for high and low frequency clock.

MPSL 0.5.0-1.prealpha
*********************

Initial release.

Added
=====

* Added the following MPSL library build variants:

  * ``hard-float/libmpsl_nrf52.a``
  * ``soft-float/libmpsl_nrf52.a``
  * ``softfp-float/libmpsl_nrf52.a``

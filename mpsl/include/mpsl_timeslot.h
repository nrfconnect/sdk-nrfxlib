/** @brief Requests a timeslot.
 *
 * Successful requests will result in mpsl_timeslot_signal_callback_t(@ref MPSL_TIMESLOT_SIGNAL_START).
 * Unsuccessful requests will result in a @ref MPSL_TIMESLOT_SIGNAL_BLOCKED event.
 *
 * Once the timeslot has started, the application is responsible for keeping track of timing within
 * the timeslot and for ensuring that the application’s use of the peripherals does not last for longer
 * than the granted timeslot length.
 * The recommended practice is to set up a timer interrupt that expires before the timeslot expires,
 * with enough time left for the timeslot to do any clean-up actions before the timeslot ends.
 * Such a timer interrupt can also be used to request an extension of the timeslot,
 * but there must still be enough time to clean up if the extension is not granted.
 *
 * @note The first request in a session must always be of type @ref MPSL_TIMESLOT_REQ_TYPE_EARLIEST.
 * @note The jitter in the start time of the timeslots is +/- @ref MPSL_TIMESLOT_START_JITTER_US us.
 * @note The mpsl_timeslot_signal_callback_t(@ref MPSL_TIMESLOT_SIGNAL_START) call has a latency relative to the
 *       specified timeslot start, but this does not affect the actual start time of the timeslot.
 * @note TIMER0 is reset when @ref MPSL_TIMESLOT_SIGNAL_START triggers.
 *       and is clocked at 1MHz from the high frequency (16 MHz) clock source.
 *       The scheduler uses the LFCLK source for time calculations when scheduling events.
 *       If the application uses a TIMER (sourced from the current HFCLK source) to calculate and
 *       signal the end of a timeslot, it must account for the possible clock drift between the
 *       HFCLK source and the LFCLK source.
 * @note No stack will neither access the RADIO peripheral nor the TIMER0 peripheral
 *       during the timeslot.
 *
 * @param[in] session_id  The session identifier as returned by @ref mpsl_timeslot_session_open.
 * @param[in] p_request   Pointer to the request parameters.
 *
 * @retval 0              Success
 * @retval  -NRF_EINVAL   The parameters of p_request are not valid
 * @retval  -NRF_ENOENT   The session is not open.
 * @retval  -NRF_EAGAIN   The session is not IDLE.

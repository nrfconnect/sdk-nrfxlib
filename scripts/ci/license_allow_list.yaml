# List of licenses allowed by the "license_check.py" script.
# Key is a license identifier, value is a regular expression (see Python's
# re.search) that matches the files that are allowed to have the license.
# The value can be multiline string. Each line is a regexp that can optionally
# start with a '!' character to indicate that it is a negative match.
# File paths are relative to west workspace directory.
# Special key "none" match no license. Special key "any" match any license
# including no license.
# You can add a '-' character to the beginning of the license identifier to
# allow specific license, but using it will generate a warning.

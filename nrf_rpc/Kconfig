	  Enable nRF RPC (Remote Procedure Call) library

if NRF_RPC

config NRF_RPC_CBOR
	bool "Add CBOR layer"
	default y
	select ZCBOR
	select ZCBOR_STOP_ON_ERROR
	help
	  Adds API that helps use of CBOR library for data serialization.

config NRF_RPC_ZCBOR_BACKUPS
	int "Number of ZCBOR backups"
	default 0
	help
	  ZCBOR needs to take a backup for each list/map. The application should
	  configure this to be the maximum list depth expected in the CBOR data.
	  E.g., if we have a nested list (2 levels deep) then ZCBOR will need 2
	  backup states.

config NRF_RPC_CMD_CTX_POOL_SIZE
	int "Number of available context structures for commands"
	default 8
	range 2 32
	help
	  nRF RPC need to store some data to handle commands. Pool of contexts
	  is created to avoid dynamic memory allocation. Setting this value too
	  low will cause unnecessary waits for available context. Minimum value
	  that is ensured to work without waiting is the sum of the number of
	  threads in both local and remote pool.

config NRF_RPC_GROUP_INIT_WAIT_TIME
	int "Group initialization timeout"
	default 1000
	range 10 5000
	help
	  The time period to wait for the remote cores to send group init responses with
	  destination group ids.
	  The time is given in miliseconds.

config NRF_RPC_THREAD_POOL_SIZE
	int "Number of threads in local thread pool"
	default 3
	range 1 32
	help
	  Thread pool is used to execute commands and events that arrived from
	  the remote side. If there is no available threads then remote side
	  will wait.

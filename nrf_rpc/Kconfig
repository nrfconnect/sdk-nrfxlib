	help
	  nRF RPC need to store some data to handle commands. Pool of contexts
	  is created to avoid dynamic memory allocation. Setting this value too
	  low will cause unnecessary waits for available context. Minimum value
	  that is ensured to work without waiting is the sum of the number of
	  threads in both local and remote pool.

	int "Number of threads in local thread pool"
	default 3
	range 1 32
	help
	  Thread pool is used to execute commands and events that arrived from
	  the remote side. If there is no available threads then remote side
	  will wait.

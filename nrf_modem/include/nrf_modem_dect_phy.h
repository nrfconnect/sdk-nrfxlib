	 *
	 * The period is split into up to 64 individual integration periods, each period
	 * being an integer multiple of a symbol duration (2880 modem time units). All integration
	 * periods have the same length, maximum 7 symbols. The maximum number of integration

	 * symbol long integration periods. If necessary the LBT period may be shortened slightly

	 * a period of 71 symbols will effectively be 70 symbols long (35 periods of 2 symbols).
	 *

	 * the channel. Instead the modem will report an error. Rescheduling a transmission is left

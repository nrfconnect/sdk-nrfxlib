The DECT NR+ interface in the Modem library is used to control the DECT NR+ firmware.

The DECT NR+ firmware is a variant of the nRF91x1 firmware with a different radio technology than the cellular firmware.
In particular, the DECT NR+ firmware does not support cellular operation or the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).

For details about the key hardware capabilities of the nRF91x1 DKs and their DECT NR+ firmware implementation with regard to the DECT NR+ standard, refer to the `nRF9151 DECT NR+ product specification`_.

.. note::
   To obtain the DECT NR+ firmware, you must contact the Nordic Semiconductor sales department.

For more details about the Modem library features that are available for each firmware variant, see :ref:`nrf_modem_variants`.

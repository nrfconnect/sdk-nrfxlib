nrf_modem 1.5.0
***************

* Added support for deferred processing of modem traces.
  Introduced the :c:func:`nrf_modem_trace_processed_callback` function that the application must call after it has processed a trace received in :c:func:`nrf_modem_os_trace_put`.
* It is now possible to unset the AT notification handler by passing NULL to :c:func:`nrf_modem_at_notif_handler_set`.

* Fixed a bug where closing a socket while another thread was in a :c:func:`recv` operation on the same socket would result in a crash.
* Fixed a bug in the delta DFU interface where the :c:func:`nrf_modem_delta_dfu_offset` call returns an unexpected error code in some cases.

nrf_modem 1.4.1
***************

* Fixed a bug in :c:func:`nrf_send` which could result in the function incorrectly returning -1 and setting the errno to ``NRF_EINPROGRESS``.

* Added support for binding RAW sockets to PDNs.

nrf_modem 1.0.1

* Fixed an overflow in timeout computation.
* Operations on sockets that do not match the socket family now return ``NRF_EAFNOSUPPORT`` instead of ``NRF_EINVAL``.
* Creating a socket when no sockets are available now returns ``NRF_ENOBUFS`` instead of ``NRF_ENOMEM``.
* Improved validation of family, type, and protocol arguments in socket().
* Improved validation of supported flags on send() and recv() for protocols.

bsdlib 0.6.1
************

* Implemented TLS host name verification.
* Implemented TLS session caching, enabled by default.
* Added the :c:func:`nrf_setdnsaddr` function to set the secondary DNS address.
* Removed unused ``BSD_MAX_IP_SOCKET_COUNT`` and ``BSD_MAX_AT_SOCKET_COUNT`` macros.
* Fixed a bug that prevented the application from detecting AGPS notifications.
* Fixed a bug where the application could not allocate the 8th socket.

  From now on, the application is responsible for provisioning keys using the AT command **%CMNG**.
* Removed the ``nrf_apn_class`` API.
  From now on, the application is responsible for handling the Access Point Name (APN) class.
* Removed the crypto dependency towards ``nrf_oberon`` from the library.
  The library does not need any special cryptography functions anymore, because the application is now responsible for signing AT commands.

bsdlib 0.5.1
************

* Fixed internal memory issue in GNSS, which lead to crash when running for hours.

bsdlib 0.5.0
************

* bsd_irrecoverable_handler() has been removed.
  The application no longer needs to implement it to receive errors during initialization, which are instead reported through bsd_init().
* bsd_shutdown() now returns an integer.
* Added RAW socket support.
* Added missing AGPS data models.
* Added APGS notification support.
* Fixed an issue where AGPS data could not be written when the GPS socket was in stopped state.
* Fixed a memory leak in GPS socket.


bsdlib 0.4.3
************

Updated the library with the following changes:

* Added support for signaling if a peer sends larger TLS fragments than receive buffers can handle.
  If this scenario is triggered, ``NRF_ENOBUFS`` is reported in recv().
  The link is also disconnected on TLS level by issuing an ``Encryption Alert``, and TCP is reset from the device side.
  Subsequent calls to send() or recv() report ``NRF_ENOTCONN``.
  The feature will be supported in an upcoming modem firmware version.
* Resolved an issue where sending large TLS messages very close to each other in time would result in a blocking send() that did not return.

bsdlib 0.4.2
************

* Reduced ROM footprint.
* Miscellaneous improvements to PDN sockets.
* Fixed an issue when linking with mbedTLS.


bsdlib 0.4.1
************

Updated the library with the following changes:

* Added socket option ``NRF_SO_PDN_CONTEXT_ID`` for PDN protocol sockets to retrieve the Context ID of the created PDN.
* Added socket option ``NRF_SO_PDN_STATE`` for PDN protocol socket to check the active state of the PDN.
* Fixed a TCP stream empty packet indication when a blocking receive got the peer closed notification while waiting for data to arrive.
* Fixed an issue where IP sockets did not propagate a fine-grained error reason, and all disconnect events resulted in ``NRF_ENOTCONN``.
  Now the error reasons could be one of the following: ``NRF_ENOTCONN``, ``NRF_ECONNRESET``, ``NRF_ENETDOWN``, ``NRF_ENETUNREACH``.
* Fixed an issue with a blocking send() operation on IP sockets that was not really blocking but returning immediately in case of insufficient memory to perform the operation.
  The new behavior is that blocking sockets will block until the message is sent.
  Also, because of internal limitations, a non-blocking socket might block for a short while until shortage of memory has been detected internally, and then return with errno set to ``NRF_EAGAIN``.
* Corrected errno that is set by send() from ``NRF_ENOMEM`` to ``NRF_EMSGSIZE`` in case of attempts on sending larger messages than supported by the library.
* Added a define ``BSD_IP_MAX_MESSAGE_SIZE`` in :file:`bsd_limits.h` to hint what size is used to report ``NRF_EMSGSIZE`` in the updated send() function.
* Fixed an issue with nrf_inbuilt_key_read() not respecting the ``p_buffer_len`` input parameter, making it possible for the library to write out-of-bounds on the buffer provided.


bsdlib 0.4.0
************

* Added AGPS support to GNSS socket driver.
* Added support for GNSS power save modes.
* Added support for deleting stored GPS data.
* Changed NRF_CONFIG_NMEA* define names to NRF_GNSS_NMEA* for alignment.

************

* Improved the PDN socket close (``NRF_PROTO_PDN``) function.
* Added new errno values ``NRF_ENOEXEC``, ``NRF_ENOSPC``, and ``NRF_ENETRESET``.
* Added a return value on bsd_init() to indicate MODEM_DFU result codes or initialization result.
* Corrected GNSS struct :c:type:`nrf_gnss_datetime_t` to use correct size on the ms member.
* Updated modem DFU interface.
* Improved error reporting on network or connection loss.

************

Updated library with various changes:

* Corrected GNSS API to not fault if not read fast enough.
* Improved length reporting on GNSS NMEA strings to report length until zero-termination.
* Improved closing of GNSS socket. If closed, it will now also stop the GNSS from running.
* Corrected bitmask value of NRF_GNSS_SV_FLAG_UNHEALTHY.
* Added side API for APN Class management.
* Removed NRF_SO_PDN_CLASS from nrf_socket.h as it is replaced by side API for APN class management.
* Improved nrf_poll() error return on non-timeout errors to be NRF_EAGAIN, to align with standard return codes from poll().
* Added implementation of inet_pton() and inet_ntop().
* Added empty packet to indicate EOF when TCP peer has closed the connection.
* Added NRF_POLLHUP to poll() bitmask to indicate sockets that peer has closed the connection (EOF).

bsdlib 0.3.0
************

Updated library with experimental GNSS support.

bsdlib 0.2.4
************

Updated library with bug fixes:

* Fix issue of reporting NRF_POLLIN on a socket handle using nrf_poll, even if no new data has arrived.

bsdlib 0.2.3
************

Updated library with various changes:

* Updated library to use nrf_oberon v3.0.0.
* Updated the library to be deployed without inbuilt libc or libgcc symbols
  (-nostdlib -nodefaultlibs -nostartfiles -lnosys).
* Fixed issues with some unresolved symbols internal to the library.
* Updated API towards bsd_os_timedwait function.
  The timeout parameter is now an in and out parameter.
  The bsd_os implementation is now expected to set the remaining time left of the time-out value in return.

bsdlib 0.2.2
************

Updated library with API for setting APN name when doing getaddrinfo request.

* Providing API through nrf_getaddrinfo, ai_next to set a second hint that defines the APN name to use for getaddrinfo query.
  The hint must be using NRF_AF_LTE, NRF_SOCK_MGMT, and NRF_PROTO_PDN as family, type, and protocol.
  The APN is set through the ai_canonname field.

bsdlib 0.2.1
************

Updated library with bug fixes:

* Updated ``nrf_inbuilt_key.h`` with smaller documentation fixes.
* Bug fix in the ``nrf_inbuilt_key`` API to allow PSK and Identity to be provisioned successfully.

* Bug fix in proprietary trace log.

bsdlib 0.2.0
************

Updated library and header files:

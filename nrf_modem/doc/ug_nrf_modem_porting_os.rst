Porting the Modem library to your OS
####################################

   :depth: 2

The :ref:`nrf_modem` from Nordic Semiconductor is an OS-agnostic C library.
OS-specific parts are moved out of the library.
To use the library with your OS or scheduler, you must first port it by creating a custom :file:`nrf_modem_os.c` file, which serves as an OS abstraction layer.
The library exposes a :file:`nrf_modem_os.h` header file that defines the functions that must be implemented in :file:`nrf_modem_os.c`.
The header file also exposes the functions provided by the library that the OS integration module must interface with.

The following diagram presents the Modem library OS abstraction layer.
Arrows indicate that the elements can communicate with each other directly.

Creating the OS abstraction layer
*********************************

To create an OS abstraction layer for the Modem library, you must implement the functions in the :file:`nrf_modem_os.h` file.

nrf_modem_os_init
=================

This function is called by the Modem library when the application has issued :c:func:`nrf_modem_init`.
It is responsible for preparing IRQ for low priority Modem library scheduling and trace scheduling.

.. note::
   When working with an application based on Zephyr, set the IRQs to a low priority (6 or 7) and enable them before exiting the function.

The function must also initialize the timers and threads (if there is a context that needs a timeout).
If Nordic Proprietary trace is enabled, the library generates trace data and forwards it to a medium that can be initialized or configured by using the :c:func:`nrf_modem_os_init` function.
The forwarded trace data is handled in the :c:func:`nrf_modem_os_trace_put` function.
See :ref:`trace_output_function` for more information.

*Required actions*:

* Initialize timers/threads.
* Configure low priority Modem library scheduling IRQ (SoftIRQ).
* Configure low priority trace scheduling IRQ (SoftIRQ).
* Configure medium for trace (for example, UART or SPI).

nrf_modem_os_timedwait
======================

This function is called by the Modem library when a timed context or sleep is required.
A blind return value of 0 will make all the Modem library operations always blocking.

*Required actions* to make the operations non-blocking:

* Start counting the time (this can be based on a Timer or Thread for instance).
* Report back the remaining time of the timer if the specific timer is interrupted.
* If timed out, report NRF_ETIMEDOUT.

nrf_modem_os_alloc
==================

This function is called by the library to allocate memory dynamically, and it is like a *malloc* call.
There are no specific requirements related to the location where this memory must be allocated in RAM.

nrf_modem_os_free
=================

This function must free the memory allocated by :c:func:`nrf_modem_os_alloc`.

nrf_modem_os_shm_tx_alloc
=========================

This function is called by the library to dynamically allocate the memory that must be *shared with the modem core*.
This function allocates memory on the TX memory region that is passed to the :c:func:`nrf_modem_init` function during the initialization.

nrf_modem_os_shm_tx_free
========================

This function releases the memory allocated by :c:func:`nrf_modem_os_shm_tx_alloc`.

nrf_modem_os_errno_set
======================

This function translates errnos from the Modem library to the OS-defined ones.

*Required action*:

* Implement a translation for each errno set by the Modem library.
  If it overlaps with your OS errno, the translation is not needed.

nrf_modem_os_application_irq_clear
==================================

This function is called by the Modem library when the library wants to clear IRQ on the low priority Modem library scheduling IRQ.

*Required action*:

* Clear the low priority Modem library scheduling IRQ using OS primitives or NVIC functions.

nrf_modem_os_application_irq_set
================================

This function is called by the Modem library when the library wants to set a pending IRQ on the low priority Modem library scheduling IRQ.

*Required action*:

* Set a pending IRQ on the low priority Modem library scheduling IRQ using OS primitives or NVIC functions.

nrf_modem_os_trace_irq_clear
============================

This function is called by the Modem library when the library wants to clear IRQ on the low priority trace scheduling IRQ.

*Required action*:

* Clear the low priority trace scheduling IRQ using OS primitives or NVIC functions.

nrf_modem_os_trace_irq_set
==========================

This function is called by the Modem library when the library wants to set a pending IRQ on the low priority trace scheduling IRQ.

*Required action*:

* Set a pending IRQ on the low priority trace scheduling IRQ using OS primitives or NVIC functions.

.. _trace_output_function:

nrf_modem_os_trace_put
======================

This function puts the trace string to the desired medium, typically UART.
However, the medium used to forward and store the traces is up to the implementation and must be initialized correctly before using.
Once the traces are processed or stored, the :c:func:`nrf_modem_trace_processed_callback` must be called.
Even if you do not want the traces further, you need to ensure that :c:func:`nrf_modem_trace_processed_callback` is called for each received trace.
Until the :c:func:`nrf_modem_trace_processed_callback` is called, the Modem library do not free up the memory allocated for that trace in the trace memory area.
Since the modem uses this trace memory area to send traces, not calling the :c:func:`nrf_modem_trace_processed_callback`, leads to losing modem traces.

nrf_modem_application_irq_handler
=================================

This function is implemented in the Modem library and must be called upon the low priority Modem library IRQ handler, triggered by the :c:func:`nrf_modem_os_application_irq_set` function.

nrf_modem_trace_irq_handler
===========================

This function is implemented in the Modem library and must be called upon the low priority trace IRQ handler, triggered by the :c:func:`nrf_modem_os_trace_irq_set` function.

nrf_modem_os_log
================

This function is called by the library to output logs.
This function can be called in an interrupt context.

nrf_modem_os_logdump
====================

This function is called by the library to dump binary data.
This function can be called in an interrupt context.

nrf_modem_os_log_strdup
=======================

The Modem library calls this function for each logged string that does not reside in read-only memory.
The returned value will be a pointer to a string that can be logged correctly by the logging functions.
This function might be necessary for some implementations of the logging functions, which might, for example, defer the logging at a later point in time.


Other scenarios to handle in nrf_modem_os.c
===========================================

#. In case the OS has its own IRQ handler scheme, which is not directly forwarding the IPC_IRQHandler to the Modem library, this must be routed by the OS.
   The OS must call IPC_IRQHandler() upon all IRQs with IRQ number IPC_IRQn.

#. In :file:`nrf_modem_os.c`, you can configure a desired medium for forwarding the trace data upon :c:func:`nrf_modem_os_trace_put` calls.

Memory
******

The Modem library needs a region of RAM within the first lower 128KB to share with the modem.
To be accessible by both the modem and the application, this region of RAM must be configured as non-secure by the secure application.

The following RAM overview diagram shows the placement of Modem library in the sequential RAM, and it also indicates the configurable memory position values.

Peripheral requirements
***********************

As the Modem library has been compiled to operate on peripherals in the non-secure domain, the following two peripherals must be configured to be non-secure:

* NRF_IPC
* NRF_POWER

If you are using the hard-float variant of the Modem library, the FPU must be activated in both the secure domain and the non-secure domain, and must be configured to allow the non-secure application to run FPU instructions.

The :file:`nrfx/mdk/system_nrf9160.c` file provides a template on how to configure the FPU in both cases.
The system file also provides several Errata workarounds specific to the chip variant used, which are needed for any secure domain application.

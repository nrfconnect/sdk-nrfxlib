/**
 * @brief Module that defines the Low Power Timer Abstraction Layer for the nrf_802154_sl_timer service
 *
 * @details
 * Design claims:
 * 1. lptimer works in @c lpticks (Low Power Timer Ticks), it is not aware of other timer units with
 *    exception to convenience functions for calculating lpticks to other units.
 * 2. One @c lptick is at least 1 microsecond, but can be greater.
 * 3. lptimer can rarely fire spurious "timer fired" callout as well as rarely perform spurious (D)PPI
 *    triggering (if connections have been made). This phenomena should be avoided, but modules relying
 *    on lptimer must be immune to such behavior.
 * 4. lptimer counts @c lpticks as @c uint64_t type, handling (and hiding from higher layers) any
 *    underlying RTC overflow events.

nRF 802.15.4 Radio Driver
#########################

The nRF 802.15.4 Radio Driver is a set of libraries that implement the IEEE 802.15.4 functionalities for the SoCs from the nRF52, nRF53 and nRF54L Series.
The following functionalities are implemented:

* Frame transmission.
* Frame reception and filtering.
* Acknowledgments.
  It allows sending and receiving acknowledgments according to the protocol specification and the timing requirements.
  Both ``Imm-Acks`` and ``Enh-Acks`` are supported.
* Promiscuous mode.
* Low power (sleep) mode.
* Carrier transmission.
  It allows sending a carrier wave continuously, either modulated or unmodulated.
  This feature can be used for radio tests.
* Multiprotocol support.
  It allows the concurrency of Bluetooth LE and 802.15.4 operations.
* CSMA/CA support.
  It provides a built-in CSMA/CA mechanism, optimized for performance.
* Delayed transmission and reception.
  It allows the scheduling of transmissions and receptions, to execute them at a predefined moment.
  It can be used for features like CSL, TSCH, and Zigbee GPP.
* Timestamping.
  It provides precise frame timestamps.
* PA/LNA.
  It allows the Radio Driver to control an external PA/LNA module to amplify the RF signal.
* The RxOnWhenIdle mode of operation.
  When the RxOnWhenIdle mode is enabled, the radio is in the receive state during idle periods.
  Otherwise, the radio is disabled.

The 802.15.4 Radio Driver consists of the following libraries:

* 802.15.4 Radio Core
* 802.15.4 Service Layer
* 802.15.4 Serialization

The libraries are compatible with the following SoCs:

* nRF52833
* nRF52840
* nRF5340
* nRF54L15
* nRF54L10
* nRF54L05
* nRF54LM20A
